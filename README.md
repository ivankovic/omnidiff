Fast, robust, accurate content-aware diffing.

- **Fast:** under 100ms for 93% of code changes
- **Robust:** can diff 99.95% of code changes
- **Accurate:** 70% of code changes perfect, 90% near-perfect
- **Content-aware:** 98.8% of all changed files diffed by what they hold - code in 24 languages by
  its syntax, other text by lines, and pictures, archives, fonts, cursors, message catalogs and
  PDFs by their content

inserted; on the other, OmniDiff paints only the parts that changed - `sum(numbers)` and
`len(numbers)` rather than the whole assignment, and `numbers` shown as moved rather than
rewritten.](/assets/diff-vs-omnidiff.gif)

**[See it in the browser](https://ivankovic.github.io/omnidiff/showcase/)**: twenty real changes,
recorded from the command-line tool and compared side by side in Unix `diff` and in OmniDiff.

The terminal UI, in its light theme:

Files that are not code are diffed by what they hold, where `git diff` only says `Binary files
differ`. A PDF diagram with one box renamed, and a web font with twenty icons redrawn:

a/CommunicationModel_en.pdf and b/CommunicationModel_en.pdf differ". Then OmniDiff, as git's
external diff, reports that the metadata and page 1 changed and where. Then OmniDiff's viewer lists
the changed members and shows page 1 before and after side by side, the renamed box outlined on
both, and then the difference alone.](/assets/content/pdf-x-governikus-ausweisapp-522d8b0b-communicationmodel_en.gif)

# Installation

## From source

```
cargo install --locked omnidiff
```

This command builds OmniDiff from source, with the dependency versions it was tested with. You
need a C compiler on `PATH` and a Rust toolchain, rustc 1.92 or later. The build compiles every tree-sitter grammar from C.
The first `cargo install` takes a few minutes, because of this and the `lto = "fat"` release
profile.

## Prebuilt binaries

Prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon), and Windows are attached to every
[GitHub release](https://github.com/ivankovic/omnidiff/releases/latest).

## Homebrew

macOS and Linux:

```
brew install ivankovic/omnidiff/omnidiff
```

## Debian and Ubuntu

`.deb` packages are available in a signed apt repository, so `apt upgrade` picks up new
versions like any other package. amd64 and arm64:

```sh
sudo install -d -m 0755 /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://ivankovic.github.io/omnidiff/apt/omnidiff-archive-keyring.gpg \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/omnidiff-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/omnidiff-archive-keyring.gpg] \
https://ivankovic.github.io/omnidiff/apt stable main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/omnidiff.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update && sudo apt install omnidiff
```

## Nix and NixOS

On NixOS, or anywhere with Nix installed, no installation step is needed at all:

```
nix run github:ivankovic/omnidiff
```

If flakes are not enabled in your Nix configuration, add
`--extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'` after `nix`.

## Arch and Gentoo

Recipes for Arch and Gentoo live in [`packaging/`](packaging/): the PKGBUILD builds locally with
`makepkg -si`, and the Gentoo ebuild is ready for an overlay.

## Editor integration

VS Code does not yet let an extension replace its built-in diff view. The API is implemented
upstream but unreleased; the extension will adopt it when it ships.

* **VS Code** - [omnidiff-vscode](https://github.com/ivankovic/omnidiff-vscode). Search for
  **OmniDiff** in the Extensions view, or `code --install-extension ivankovic.omnidiff`. Also on
  [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ivankovic/omnidiff) for VSCodium, Cursor and Windsurf.
* **Neovim** - [omnidiff.nvim](https://github.com/ivankovic/omnidiff.nvim).

# Using OmniDiff

## The interactive TUI

```
omnidiff                  # open an empty viewer; press o to pick each file
omnidiff BEFORE AFTER     # open directly into the diff of two files
```

Press `?` in the viewer for the full list of keybindings.

The TUI uses 24-bit color when the terminal advertises it with `COLORTERM=truecolor`, and the
nearest 256 colors otherwise (macOS Terminal.app, or most terminals over ssh, which does not
forward `COLORTERM`). If your terminal supports 24-bit color but does not set it, run
`export COLORTERM=truecolor`.

## In a browser

For reviewing changes in a browser, see [codereview](https://github.com/ivankovic/codereview).
Note: codereview is at v0.0.0; use it at your own risk.

## Headless / batch mode

`omnidiff --headless BEFORE AFTER`, or its synonym `--batch`, prints the diff as plain text, with
optional color, instead of opening the TUI. Use this for scripts, CI, or any case where stdout is
not a real terminal. Headless mode also starts automatically whenever stdout is not a terminal, for
example when piped into `less` or redirected to a file. Because of this, `omnidiff BEFORE AFTER |
less` works without the flag.

Every printed line is prefixed with its line number, so the moved-chunk headers' "Moved to lines
40-60" cross-references can actually be followed. OmniDiff collapses long runs of unchanged
lines. It keeps 3 lines of context on each side of a change (override with `--context N`), the
same convention as `diff -u`. OmniDiff also prefixes each hunk with the nearest enclosing
function, class, or struct line, when that line is not otherwise visible. This shows the location
of a change deep inside a large file.

Colors are on by default (git's pager renders them); pass `--color never`, or set `NO_COLOR=1`, to
disable ANSI colors, for example when you redirect output to a file - `--color always` forces them
even under `NO_COLOR`.

OmniDiff exits `0` on success and `2` on error. For scripting, pass `--exit-code` to additionally
get `1` when the files differ, the `diff(1)` convention. That is opt-in rather than the default
for the same reason `git diff` exits `0` even when files differ: OmniDiff's usual non-interactive
callers are version control systems driving it as a display tool, and they read a non-zero exit as
"the tool failed" - `jj` warns on every file, and `git difftool` with `difftool.trustExitCode=true`
aborts the whole diff. (The 7-argument `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` form stays at `0` even with
`--exit-code`, since git treats a non-zero exit there as fatal.)

## JSON output

`omnidiff --mode json BEFORE AFTER` prints the diff as one JSON object, for editors and tools that
place highlights on their own buffers. Each side carries its path, its detected language and its
hunks, and each hunk is an operation (`delete`, `insert`, `update`, `move`) with a range in that
side's own file:

```json
{
  "before": {
    "path": "old.rs",
    "language": "Rust",
    "hunks": [
      { "operation": "delete", "range": { "start_row": 12, "start_column": 4, "end_row": 12, "end_column": 20 },
        "reference_line": 10 }
    ]
  },
  "after": { "path": "new.rs", "language": "Rust", "hunks": [] },
  "large_residual": false,
  "summary": "comment_only"
}
```

Rows and columns are 0-indexed, and columns are byte offsets within their row, as tree-sitter
reports them. `reference_line` is the row of the nearest enclosing named declaration, and a
`move` also carries a `move_target` range in the other file. `summary` is present only when the diff is one of the special shapes the TUI's
status bar names, such as `comment_only` or `whitespace_only`. A binary file on either side
answers with `"binary": true` and empty hunks; when it is [supported content](#supported-content),
a `content` object says what changed in it (a picture also keeps the older `picture` object). A
side read from UTF-16 or UTF-32 carries its `encoding`, and its ranges are in the decoded text. Unlike headless mode, JSON output is never chosen
automatically: only `--mode json` selects it, so a pipe never receives it by surprise. The
[VS Code extension](https://github.com/ivankovic/omnidiff-vscode) is built on this output; the
authoritative field list is `src/tui/json_output.rs`.

## Git integration

OmniDiff is a `git difftool` backend. Run the interactive setup wizard, which asks
whether to configure it globally or for the current repository only:

```
omnidiff git configure
```

Or configure it by hand:

```
git config difftool.omnidiff.cmd 'omnidiff "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"'
git difftool --tool=omnidiff
```

Run `git config diff.tool omnidiff` to make plain `git difftool` use OmniDiff by default, without
needing `--tool`. If you do not want git to ask "view diff ... [Y/n]?" before every file, run `git
config difftool.prompt false`.

**`git difftool` opens the interactive TUI. `git diff` and `git log -p` never do.** `git diff`
pipes its output through git's pager, and a full-screen TUI cannot draw onto a pipe, so OmniDiff
always falls back to plain text there regardless of terminal or `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` config (see
"Headless / batch mode" above). If you want the interactive viewer from git, use `git difftool`,
not `git diff`. If `git difftool` still doesn't open interactively over SSH, reconnect with
`ssh -t` — the session needs an allocated pseudo-terminal; tmux panes always have one.

OmniDiff also works directly with `git diff` and `git log -p`, through `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF`. This
path needs no `difftool` config:

```
GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=omnidiff git diff
```

Pictures, archives, fonts and the rest of the [supported content](#supported-content) get a short
report of what changed in them. Any other binary file gets a one-line `Binary file <path> differs`
notice instead of a diff, the same stand-in git and `diff(1)` print for them. Neither ever blocks
the rest of a `git diff`: an external diff that exits non-zero makes git abandon the *entire* run,
so OmniDiff reports an unshowable file as a successful diff of nothing rather than as a failure.

## Jujutsu (jj) integration

jj does not read git's `difftool`/`diff.external` settings, even in a colocated repo, so it needs
its own configuration. Run the setup wizard:

```
omnidiff jj configure
```

Or configure it by hand:

```
jj config set --user merge-tools.omnidiff.program omnidiff
jj config set --user merge-tools.omnidiff.diff-args '["$left","$right"]'
jj config set --user merge-tools.omnidiff.diff-invocation-mode file-by-file
```

That registers `jj diff --tool omnidiff`. To make it the default for plain `jj diff` as well:

```
jj config set --user ui.diff-formatter omnidiff
```

Use `--repo` in place of `--user` to configure the current repository only.

**`diff-invocation-mode = "file-by-file"` is required.** jj's default hands a diff tool two
*directory* trees; OmniDiff diffs two files, so without this setting every invocation fails. With
it, jj passes one changed file pair at a time, keeping each file's real path and extension, so
language detection works exactly as it does under git.

`jj diff` runs its formatter under a pager, so OmniDiff renders in its non-interactive text mode
there - the same output `git diff` gets. jj has no equivalent of `git difftool`'s interactive
per-file viewer (its terminal-attached hook, `ui.diff-editor`, is for `jj diffedit`/`jj split`,
which edit the right-hand side and read it back - not something a read-only viewer should claim to
do), so for the full-screen TUI on a jj repo, run `omnidiff BEFORE AFTER` directly.

# Supported languages

The language is detected from the file extension. A file with an unknown extension is diffed as
plain text, line by line, so nothing is refused.

<!-- languages:start -->
24 languages are parsed with a tree-sitter grammar and diffed structurally:

| Language | File extensions |
|---|---|
| C | `.c`, `.h` |
| C# | `.cs` |
| C++ | `.cc`, `.cpp`, `.cxx`, `.hpp`, `.hh`, `.hxx` |
| CSS | `.css`, `.scss` |
| Go | `.go` |
| HTML | `.html`, `.htm` |
| Java | `.java` |
| JavaScript | `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.jsx` |
| JSON | `.json` |
| Kotlin | `.kt` |
| Lua | `.lua` |
| PHP | `.php` |
| Python | `.py`, `.pyi`, `.pyw` |
| R | `.r` |
| Ruby | `.rb` |
| Rust | `.rs` |
| Scala | `.scala` |
| Shell (Bash) | `.bash`, `.sh` |
| Swift | `.swift` |
| TSX | `.tsx` |
| TypeScript | `.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts` |
| Vimscript | `.vim` |
| XML | `.xml`, `.xht`, `.xhtml`, `.svg`, `.glif`, `.plist`, `.ui`, `.qrc`, `.glade`, `.xib`, `.storyboard`, `.xaml`, `.vcxproj`, `.filters`, `.csproj`, `.fsproj`, `.vbproj`, `.props`, `.targets`, `.nuspec`, `.resx`, `.wxs`, `.iml`, `.manifest`, `.config`, `.policy`, `.xsd`, `.xsl`, `.xslt`, `.xlf`, `.xliff`, `.kml`, `.gpx`, `.rss`, `.atom`, `.graphml`, `.dae` |
| YAML | `.yaml`, `.yml` |

Recognised by extension but diffed as plain text, since no grammar is compiled in: Bazel (`.bazel`), Dart (`.dart`), Emacs Lisp (`.el`), Markdown (`.md`, `.markdown`), Protocol Buffers (`.proto`), SQL (`.sql`).
<!-- languages:end -->

# Supported content

Files that are not text are recognised by their bytes, never by their names, and diffed by what
they hold:

| Content | Formats | Diffed |
|---|---|---|
| Pictures | PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, ICO, TIFF | pixel by pixel, as the eye compares them: how much changed and where; animations frame by frame |
| Archives | zip (and so jar, Office documents, EPUB), tar, gzip, xz, bzip2 | file by file, each by what it is, archives inside archives included; Java class files as a listing of their fields and methods |
| Fonts | TrueType, OpenType, WOFF, WOFF2, EOT | glyph by glyph, each drawn, and the font's names and metrics |
| Cursors | Windows `.cur` and `.ani`, X cursors, Hyprland `.hlc` | size by size and frame by frame |
| Message catalogs | gettext `.mo`, Qt `.qm` | message by message |
| Documents | PDF | page by page, each page drawn |
| Text in other encodings | UTF-16 and UTF-32 with a byte order mark | as text, like any other file |

Only the members that changed are opened, so a font with two edited glyphs shows two glyphs. Each
change is also named by how much of it a reader would see: invisible (only the bytes differ),
imperceptible, artifacts (what compression or resampling leaves behind), edited, redrawn or
replaced - for text, whitespace, formatting and rewritten stand in for the second, third and
fifth.

The TUI shows pictures as pictures: in the terminal's own graphics where it speaks the kitty,
sixel or iTerm2 protocol, and in Unicode half blocks everywhere else. `b` switches to half blocks
and back, and `OMNIDIFF_GRAPHICS=halfblocks` (or `kitty`, `sixel`, `iterm2`) overrides the
detection; inside tmux, the terminal in front of the pane decides. An archive, a font or any other
container lists its changed members beside the one selected, `g` shows every changed glyph or
picture at once, and `Enter` opens a text member in the full diff view.

Anything else binary gets the one-line `Binary file <path> differs` notice.

# Guiding principles

## Fast

OmniDiff's goal is:

* **A median diff in 100ms or less.**
* **A 99th-percentile diff in 1000ms or less.**

Both are met. Over the fixtures in `src/test/data/diffs/`, about 2,000, measured 2026-09-18 on an
Intel Xeon E3-1275 v5 (4 cores, 8 threads) with 64 GB RAM: **p50 7.6ms, p90 78.7ms, p99 347ms**,
slowest 1,355ms. **100ms is the 92.7th percentile** — 146 fixtures take longer than that, and 2
take longer than a second.

Runtime is reported, never gated: `make check-quality` prints this distribution against the
committed baseline on every push, and warns when the runtime is more than twice the baseline's.

## Robust

OmniDiff's goal is to process 100% of all commits.

The full test dataset holds the git commit history of about 7,500 open-source git repositories,
as available on the main branch. This list of repositories comes from the Gentoo Linux
distribution. Find it in `list_of_repositories.csv`.

Measured over every modified code file in the most recent 50 commits of each of those
repositories - 442,530 readable before/after pairs in 25 languages, diffed with no size cap under
a 120-second budget and a 6 GB memory cap per process - **442,322 (99.95%) completed
successfully.** 96 pairs ran past the budget and 112 past the memory cap; the latter are twenty
files, nineteen of them generated or embedded - tree-sitter parser tables, codegen, minified
bundles, a PNG as a C array - and one commit of a 40,000-line single-header C++ library. Given
24 GB and 300 s, 11 of the 28 files that first hit the cap complete. The run, its harness and every pair that did not complete are documented in
`research/data/performance/PROVENANCE.md`.

Beyond code, over every file changed in the same window - 2,018,010 changes in 7,352
repositories, pictures, fonts and archives included - **98.8% are diffed as text or by their
content** (98.2% counting each repository at most 1,000 times, so that a few giant ones do not
decide it; 6,481 repositories entirely). What is left is mostly text in legacy encodings, compiled
objects, audio, and EOT fonts compressed with MicroType Express. The census is documented in
`research/data/corpus_stats/PROVENANCE.md`.

## Accurate

OmniDiff must match a human's own reading of a change, measured against the hand-authored
ground-truth mappings in `src/test/data/diffs/`:

* **90% of test cases with zero mismatched bytes.**
* **99% of test cases with at most 1% of bytes mismatched.**

Neither is met yet. 818 of about 2,000 fixtures carry a hand-painted ground truth - every byte of
both files labelled with what a human says happened to it - and OmniDiff's own highlighting is
compared against it byte by byte, under each of its two highlighting presets (`--full`, which keeps
brackets, separators and leading whitespace, and `--minimal`, which drops them):

| preset | zero mismatched bytes | at most 1% mismatched | mismatched bytes, whole corpus |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--full` | **539 (65.9%)** | **699 (85.5%)** | 27,865 of 28.5M (0.10%) |
| `--minimal` | **576 (70.4%)** | **728 (89.0%)** | 17,134 of 28.5M (0.06%) |

The whole-corpus rate is far below 1% because most of each file is unchanged and nobody gets that
wrong; the per-test-case numbers are the ones that count, since a reader meets the mistakes one
diff at a time. Most of what is left is not in the matching: rendering the human's own node
mapping still disagrees with the painting on 77% of the `--full` bytes and 69% of the `--minimal`
ones, so the highlighting rules own the gap more than the matcher does.

`make update-painting-attribution` measures this and writes one row per fixture and preset to
`research/data/quality/painting_attribution.csv`, which the table is counted from;
`make check-painting-attribution` fails if any fixture gets worse.

# AI policy

This project uses substantial AI assistance, currently Claude Code. Most commits disclose this
with a `Co-Authored-By` trailer and a link to the session that produced them. This project does not
hide that fact. This project does not treat AI assistance as a lesser way to write software.

Contributions are not accepted at this time, to keep the development speed high (see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)). When that changes, AI-assisted contributions will be as
welcome as any other, disclosed the same way: whoever submits the work is responsible for
understanding it and standing behind it.

# For Developers, human or otherwise

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the technology overview, code-quality and testing
