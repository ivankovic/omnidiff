"""Makes the report scripts (research/analysis/), the measurement drivers written in Python
(research/measure/) and the repository's scripts/ importable as plain modules. All three hold
executables, not packages, and every one guards its `main` behind `if __name__ == "__main__"`, so
importing them runs nothing."""
