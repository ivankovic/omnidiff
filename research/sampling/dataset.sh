# Clone depth, in commits from each remote branch tip. Overridable with --depth because the right
# value is a per-corpus tradeoff, not a constant: it bounds how far back sampling can reach, and
# `git fetch --depth=N` on an existing shallow clone *shortens* as well as deepens, so lowering it
# discards history that is already on disk.
