"""Line coverage of every test in the library's test binary, each measured alone.

`make coverage` answers "what does the suite cover". This answers "what does *each test* cover",
so the results can be combined with set operations: which lines every fixture reaches, which lines
exactly one test reaches, which tests have identical footprints. `analysis/coverage_sets.py` does
the combining; this only measures.

One test per process, by construction. The library's test binary runs a single test with
`--exact <name>`, and `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` names that process's profile, so each profile holds one
test's counters and nothing else. Running the whole suite once and splitting it afterwards is not
possible: a profile records counts, not which test incremented them.

Output, under `--out`:

  lines.tsv      index, area, file, line - every instrumented line, the bit order of every set
  records.jsonl  one line per test: name, status, seconds, lines covered per area, bits file
  bits/<key>     that test's covered lines as a little-endian bitset over lines.tsv's order

Lines in `src/test/fixtures/` are left out entirely. Each of those 1220 files is one fixture's test
stub, reached by that fixture's tests and no others, so keeping them would give every fixture test
lines "only it covers" that say nothing about the engine.

Resumable: a test already in records.jsonl is skipped, whatever its status, so a test that was
killed stays recorded as killed rather than being retried forever. Delete its line to retry it.

Run it as its own systemd unit, with every test in its own memory-capped scope - see
`research/measure/overnight_benchmarks.sh` for why (an OOM inside the shell's scope takes down the
whole session):

  systemd-run --user --unit omnidiff-per-test-coverage --collect --same-dir \\
    --setenv=PATH="$PATH" ./measure/per_test_coverage.py --binary <instrumented test binary> \\
    --out data/coverage/per_test

  systemctl --user stop omnidiff-per-test-coverage omnidiff-per-test-coverage.slice

The instrumented binary comes from `cargo llvm-cov show-env`; `make measure-per-test-coverage` in
research/Makefile builds it and starts the unit.
