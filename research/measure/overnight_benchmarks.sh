# Two measurements, run back to back on an idle machine:
#
#   R22  RQ2 re-drawn at COUNT=1000 pairs per language and re-measured - the whole
#        overnight_rq1_refresh.sh chain with SKIP_FETCH=1 (the corpus on disk is already at
#        depth 50). Timing-sensitive: every pair is held to a 1-second wall-clock budget, so
#        nothing else may run on the machine during it. Four to six hours.
#   R48  Robustness over every modified code file in the Full corpus's recent history, not just
#        the fixture corpus: the only run on this machine that reaches files the size of the
#        Robust target's ceiling. Not timing-sensitive (it records timeouts and panics, with a
#        120-second budget per pair), so it runs as $SHARDS processes at once. Tens of CPU-hours.
#
# Order matters and is fixed: build, list the R48 pairs (a git-log walk, I/O only), R22 alone,
# then R48. The list is drawn first so that R48 can start the moment R22 ends, and the build is
# first so no compile competes with R22's clock.
#
# Usage (from research/), as its own systemd unit rather than a child of the shell:
#
#   systemd-run --user --unit omnidiff-overnight --collect --same-dir \
#     ./measure/overnight_benchmarks.sh [log-file]
#
# Why a unit: when an R48 shard hits a pair that needs more memory than the machine has, the
# kernel's OOM killer takes it, and systemd then stops the whole scope the shell lives in - the
# other shards, the orchestrator and the terminal session that started it.
# A unit of its own is stopped alone. For the same reason every shard runs in its own transient
# scope with a hard memory cap (SHARD_MEMORY_MAX) below, so a pathological pair kills that shard's
# process and nothing else, and a killed shard resumes from its own output with the offending
# pair recorded as `killed` and skipped. `journalctl --user -u omnidiff-overnight` has the log.
#
# The shard scopes are not children of the unit (a scope cannot be), so they sit in a slice of
# their own, `omnidiff-r48.slice`, capped as a whole at SLICE_MEMORY_MAX. To stop everything:
#
#   systemctl --user stop omnidiff-overnight omnidiff-r48.slice
#
#   MODE=full        which corpus root under /var/tmp/research/ (both stages read the same one).
#   COUNT=1000       R22's pairs per language.
#   SHARDS=8         R48's concurrent processes.
#   SHARD_MEMORY_MAX=6G   cgroup memory cap per shard process (systemd MemoryMax syntax).
#   SLICE_MEMORY_MAX=48G  cap on all shards together, so they can never reach the system's
#                         OOM killer, which picks its own victims.
#   SKIP_R22=0       set to 1 to run R48 alone (e.g. after an R22 that already landed).
#   SKIP_LIST=0      set to 1 to reuse the pair list a previous run left under $OUT.
#   SKIP_SAMPLE=0    set to 1 to re-measure R22 against the sample already in data/samples/
#                    rather than drawing it again (stages 3 and 4 of overnight_rq1_refresh.sh
#                    alone). Sound only when that sample was drawn from the corpus on disk.
#
# Outputs. R22's land where overnight_rq1_refresh.sh puts them (data/rq1/, data/samples/, the
# paper). R48's are not committed - they are hundreds of thousands of rows reproducible from the
# clones - and go to /var/tmp/research/$MODE/robustness/: the pair list, one CSV per shard, and
# robustness_full.csv, the shards merged. Summarise from there; see data/performance/PROVENANCE.md.
