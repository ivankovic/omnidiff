# After an R48 run (measure/overnight_benchmarks.sh): give every pair that did not get a fair
# measurement a second one, then re-merge.
#
# Three groups, from the killed records (which carry the exit status the attempt died with) and
# the merged CSV:
#
#   134 / 143  SIGABRT / SIGTERM. An abort is the harness's diff thread running on a smaller
#              stack than the product's 256MB one and overflowing on files the product diffs; a
#              SIGTERM is an operator restarting a shard. Neither is a finding about the pair.
#              Re-measured under the ordinary cap.
#   137        SIGKILL, the shard's memory cap. These cluster in a few generated files (parse
#              tables, data arrays) at many commits, so one commit per distinct file is
#              re-measured under BIG_MEMORY_MAX, BIG_PARALLEL at a time, with a longer budget:
#              the row then says what that file needs, and one that dies again means "more than
#              BIG_MEMORY_MAX". The other commits of the same file keep their `killed` row.
#   timed_out  The 120-second budget was applied while eight shards shared the machine. Re-run
#              TIMEOUT_PARALLEL at a time; a pair that times out again did so on a quiet machine.
#
