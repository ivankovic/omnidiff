# One unattended run of the whole RQ1 chain: deepen the full corpus, re-draw the sampled pairs
# against it, re-measure RQ1, and rebuild the paper. Written to be started once and left alone.
#
# Why this exists as a script rather than a sequence of make invocations: the four stages must run
# strictly serially and each one's output is the next one's input, but only stage 3 is
# timing-sensitive. Interleaving them by hand is how a timing measurement ends up sharing a machine
# with a 7,445-repository git fetch.
#
# Usage (from research/):  ./measure/overnight_rq1_refresh.sh [log-file]
#
# Environment knobs, both defaulting to what the committed measurement used:
#
#   COUNT=1000       pairs per language, split over stats::sampling::LOC_BUCKETS' 7 buckets.
#   SKIP_FETCH=1     skip stage 1. Legitimate only when the corpus on disk is already at DEPTH and
#                    the sample is being re-drawn (stage 2) rather than re-measured: a fresh draw
#                    reads the checkouts themselves, so every pair it names resolves by
#                    construction, and stage 2b still proves it. Never skip it when re-measuring an
#                    existing sample, which is the decay case this script was written for.
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS FIXES. A committed data/samples/sampled_code_pairs_*.csv names
# (repository, commit, path) triples, and a checkout can stop resolving them - concentrated in
# whole repositories rather than spread evenly, so a re-measurement would silently drop entire
# projects from RQ1. The cause is
# that a sample holds pointers, not blobs, while the clones it points into are shallow and keep
# being re-fetched. Deepening the corpus first, then sampling against what is actually on disk,
# is what makes the sample resolvable; it does not make it permanent, so re-sample rather than
# re-measure whenever the unreadable fraction climbs again.
