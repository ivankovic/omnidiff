/**
 * A one-JVM-for-the-whole-run alternative to invoking `gumtree textdiff` once per fixture as a
 * fresh subprocess (see `../../../src/bin/benchmark_other.rs`'s `gumtree_line_labels`, which does
 * exactly that). That per-fixture subprocess model pays JVM startup (class loading, JIT warmup)
 * on every single invocation - dominating the measured time for small files, per
 * `benchmark_other_runtime.png`'s gumtree violin sitting almost flat around ~400ms regardless of
 * file size. This driver stays up for an entire batch, so only the first request in a run pays
 * startup cost; everything after it measures GumTree's own parse+match+edit-script work, JIT-
 * warmed the way a long-lived service would see it - not "cost of invoking GumTree the way the
 * CLI is normally used."
 *
 * Protocol: one JSON object per line on stdin, one JSON object per line on stdout, in request
 * order, flushed after each response so a caller reading incrementally never blocks on buffering.
 *
 * Request:  {"id": "<caller-chosen fixture id>", "generator": "<gumtree generator id, e.g.
 *            java-jdt>", "before": "<path to a source file>", "after": "<path to a source file>"}
 * Response: {"id": "<echoed>", "ms": <double, time inside Diff.compute + JSON serialization only,
 *            excludes reading the request line and writing the response>, "matches": [...],
 *            "actions": [...]}  - "matches"/"actions" are byte-for-byte the same schema
 *            `gumtree textdiff -f JSON` produces (both paths go through the same
 *            `ActionsIoUtils.toJson`), so any JSON consumer written against the CLI's output
 *            reads this unchanged.
 *           {"id": "<echoed>", "error": "<exception message>"} on failure for that one pair -
 *            does not stop the batch, so one bad fixture doesn't lose every result after it.
