"""Merge an R48 run's shard parts and killed records into one CSV, and summarise it.

`measure/overnight_benchmarks.sh` measures the Full corpus in shards, each of which may take
several attempts (a shard resumes after its process is killed), so a shard's measurements are
spread over `robustness_shard_<i>.part*.csv` files plus a `robustness_shard_<i>.killed.csv`
naming the pair each attempt died on and the exit status it died with. This merges them into
`robustness_full.csv` with one row per pair - the last row wins where a pair was measured more
than once, and a killed record is kept only for a pair with no measured row - and prints the
status counts and the largest pair.

Exit statuses mean different things and the summary keeps them apart: 137 is the cgroup memory
cap (the pair needs more than SHARD_MEMORY_MAX), 134 is an abort inside the process, 143 is
SIGTERM (an operator restarting a shard, not a finding). `measure/r48_retry_killed.sh`
re-measures the 134s and the 143s and gives the 137s a bigger cap, one at a time, before this is
final.
