"""
What the files a diff tool is asked about actually are: every file changed by the most recent
`--max-commits` non-merge commits of each clone, counted by extension (or by name, for files
without one) and by the file-type category of `code::tip` - the classifier behind the introductory
paper's Figure 1, which counts files at rest. This counts files in motion, which is what a diff
tool sees.

Population: the same window as `edit_shape_stats.py`, through its `numstat_rows` (shallow-boundary
commits skipped, renames attributed to the new path), but binary files kept: git's own binary
verdict (`--numstat` reports `-` for a binary file) is the `binary_changes` column.

Count repositories, not only changes. The volume is dominated by a handful of repositories: UFO font
sources (`.glif`, XML) are hundreds of thousands of changes from ten repositories, so the
`repositories` column - how many clones changed such a file at all - is what says how common a
format is.

Categories come from `classify_paths` (the Rust classifier, built by the Makefile target), applied
to one representative path per key.

Usage (from research/):  uv run ./analysis/change_census.py [--repositories DIR] [--jobs N]
