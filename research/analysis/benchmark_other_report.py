"""Compare omnidiff against other diff tools - Unix `diff`, GumTree, difftastic, diffsitter today
(`benchmark_other.rs`'s `ExternalTool` can grow more) - on line-level agreement with the
human-authored mapping, and on runtime.

Reads benchmark_other.csv (produced by
`cargo run --release --bin benchmark_other -- --csv --repeats N`), one row per fixture with
`<tool>_mismatches` (a single count - deterministic, only ever computed once) and `<tool>_ms`
(every one of the `--repeats` timing measurements for that fixture, `;`-joined into one field -
see `ms_values`) columns for omnidiff and every `ExternalTool`. See that binary's own doc comment
for what "mismatch" means (a line where the tool's touched/untouched call disagrees with the human
mapping projected down to lines - the only signal a line-based tool like Unix diff can produce at
all, so it's the fairest common ground, not node-level accuracy). A CSV from a pre-`--repeats`
build (or `--repeats 1`) still reads fine - each `_ms` field is just a one-element list then.

Writes three plots:

  - benchmark_other_accuracy.png: grouped histogram of *agreement* rate (100 - mismatch rate, so
    higher is better and 100% means every line matched the human mapping), bucketed into fixed
    10-point-wide bins spanning the full 0-100% axis - one color per tool, sharing the same bins,
    so the two distributions sit side by side within each bucket.
  - benchmark_other_runtime.png: full runtime distribution (every individual repeat, not a
    per-fixture mean), one violin per tool plus a `treesitter_parse_ms` reference violin (log-scale
    y-axis, KDE computed in log10-space - omnidiff's per-fixture times span ~3 orders of magnitude,
    so a single mean bar hides exactly the shape that matters here). The reference violin is
    tree-sitter parsing alone, with no diffing on top - the lower bound every other series must pay
    before its own work even starts.
Also writes one table (not a plot - a handful of summary numbers per tool reads better as a table
than as a chart):

  - benchmark_other_variance.tex: per-fixture coefficient of variation (stddev/mean across that
    fixture's repeats, as a %), median and p90 per tool, because `benchmark_other`'s own
    aggregate median/p90/max swings by roughly +-10% between back-to-back single-shot runs on a
    loaded machine, making a single run's numbers untrustworthy for judging a real speed change.
    Answers "how much should one
    run's number be trusted" as a companion to the runtime plot's "what does the distribution look
    like." A complete, ready-to-`\\input`-ed ACM `table` environment, so
    `research/papers/introductory-paper/main.tex` can include it directly and it never goes stale
    relative to whatever `benchmark_other.csv` says.

And one LaTeX macro fragment:

  - variables_comparison.tex: the per-tool line-level agreement and wall-clock percentiles the
    introductory paper's comparison and speed tables cite, as `\\newcommand`s. Generated rather
    than AUTHORED entries in `paper_variables.py`: ~30 numbers transcribed by hand from a console
    table is the exact failure mode the whole `variables.tex` mechanism exists to prevent (see
    `file_stats.py::write_paper_variables`'s doc comment for the slide-deck story). A fragment,
    not the file `main.tex` reads: `analysis/paper_variables.py`
    merges it into the single `plots/variables.tex`, same contract as
    `apted_only_report.py::write_paper_fragment`.

    The accuracy half reads `data/comparison/benchmark_accuracy.csv` (`make measure-tools-accuracy`),
    not this script's own `--csv` - that file carries an explicit per-tool `_status` column, so
    "scored" is a recorded fact rather than inferred from a blank cell, and it is machine- and
    load-independent. The speed half necessarily reads the timing CSV. Passing an accuracy CSV is
    therefore optional: without it, the speed macros are still written and the accuracy ones are
    simply absent, which `paper_variables.py` reports as a missing-macro warning rather than
    silently dropping.

# larger fivesome that also included unix_diff/treesitter_parse's old categorical slots, before

    algorithms report whole lines and nothing finer, so `benchmark_other.rs` records them as
    `line_only` and they have no node column to bucket. That is exactly what makes the node
    reading worth having beside the line one - it is the only place BDiff's `str_diff` character
    offsets and Neovim's `DiffText` column runs are actually exercised.

    The node metric is a "did the tool consider this node's text changed" projection, one
    granularity below the line columns - *not* node-to-node mapping fidelity, which cannot be asked
    of a tool that parses its own tree. See `benchmark_other.rs`'s `--accuracy-csv` doc comment.

    **The paper does not \input{} this file.** The line and node readings are
    one table (see [`write_combined_bucket_table`]), because two floats with identical column
    headers, one immediately after the other, read as a single table split by a page break rather

    As two separate floats with byte-identical column headers (``Tool``, ``n``, and the four
    buckets) placed one after the other, LaTeX floated them onto the same page - so a reader met
    the same header twice and read the second table as a continuation of the first rather than as
    a different granularity. The rows, subsets and buckets are exactly those the two tables
    carried, only gathered under one caption with the granularity stated as a row group rather
    than in two captions a reader has to hold side by side.

    The asymmetry between the halves is deliberate. The line half omits
    \textsc{OmniDiff} (`include_omnidiff`), because Section 7 answers RQ4 over other people's
    tools and the paper's own tool is reported in its own section; the node half includes it,
    because the node reading is where a reader asking "and where does OmniDiff land" is actually
    looking. Passing `include_omnidiff=True` puts it in both.

    **No node block.** Node-granularity rows would be a second reading of the same tools under a
    metric only half of them can be scored on. Line granularity is the single common
    ground all eleven configurations share, and it is the basis Section 8 scores \textsc{OmniDiff}
    on too, so the table now carries the two line-level blocks only. The node numbers stay

    """One violin per tool, plus a `treesitter_parse` reference violin and (when present in the
    CSV) a `gumtree_warm` reference violin, full per-fixture distribution rather than just the mean
    - omnidiff's 93 per-fixture times span ~3 orders of magnitude (3ms to 3.9s, dominated by file
    size), so a single bar hides exactly the shape that matters here. `violinplot` runs its KDE in
    log10-space (matplotlib's own kernel bandwidth assumes a linear axis, so feeding it raw ms on a
    log-scaled axis would misshape the KDE) - the y-axis ticks are then relabeled back to real ms.

    Series order and display names both come from `DISPLAY_ORDER`/`DISPLAY_NAMES` (see `ordered`),
    not from `tools`' own CSV-column order, so this plot, `plot_accuracy`, and
    `variance_table_rows` all read in the same fixed sequence regardless of which columns happen
    to appear first in the CSV: TreeSitter parse, UNIX diff, OmniDiff, GumTree (binary), GumTree
    (warm JVM), diffsitter, difftastic. `treesitter_parse` goes first: it's not a competing tool
    (no accuracy
    to score, see `plot_accuracy`'s doc comment for why it's absent there), it's the reference
    lower bound every AST-aware series to its right must pay before their own work even starts -
    reading left to right is reading the cost stack from the ground up.

    `gumtree_warm`, when present, goes right after `gumtree`: same algorithm, same accuracy, timed
    inside a persistent JVM instead of a fresh subprocess per fixture
    (`research/drivers/gumtree-batch/`) - it isolates GumTree's own cost from the JVM-startup
    overhead `gumtree`'s own violin includes. `benchmark_other.rs` only fills this column in when
    the batch driver was actually available for that run (see `gumtree_warm_batch`'s doc comment) -
    every cell blank means the whole column is absent, not scored per-fixture like `gumtree_ms` can
    be, so `tools` (built from `_mismatches` columns) never lists it and `has_gumtree_warm` checks
    for it separately.

    Each tool's violin is built from its own `applicable_rows` (see that function's doc comment) -
    a language-scoped tool like GumTree has far fewer points than omnidiff/unix_diff, so its violin
    is necessarily noisier and its x-tick carries an explicit "(n=...)" rather than implying the
    same sample size as everything else on the axis. `treesitter_parse_ms` has no scope gaps (every
    corpus language parses), so it's always full sample size, same as omnidiff.

    Every point plotted is one individual `--repeats` measurement, not a per-fixture mean/median -
    `ms_values` splits `benchmark_other.rs`'s `;`-joined column back into its full sample, so a
    fixture run with 3 repeats contributes 3 points to the violin/strip, not 1. This is what makes
    the shape here directly comparable to `variance_table_rows`' per-fixture coefficient of
    variation: both read from the same underlying repeats, just aggregated differently. `n` in
    each x-tick counts *fixtures*
    (matching `sample_sizes`' pre-existing meaning), not the larger flattened point count - the
    fixture count is what determines each violin's real independence (3 repeats of the same
    fixture are correlated with each other, not 3 independent fixtures), so it stays the honest
    number to report as "n"."""
    # The parse-only reference violin and three of the four git algorithms are dropped from this
    # figure. They are the two things that make the chart hard to read:
    # the reference violin is not a competing tool yet invites comparison as though it were, and
    # the four git series are indistinguishable by construction - this paper's own result is that
    # the choice of line-diff algorithm does not move any metric here, so plotting all four spends
    # four slots saying one thing. `git_myers` is the default and stands for them. All four remain
    # in every table and in the CSV; this is a presentation choice, not a change of scope.

    fixture and tool, so no fixture is over-weighted; that would stop being true if repeats ever
    became adaptive (as they are in `benchmark_diff_pairs`, which skips repeats for already-slow
    pairs). Returns None for a series with no measurements.

    For `omnidiff` the parse is added back in. `benchmark_other` calls `ensure_parsed()` on every
    fixture *before* timing starts, so `omnidiff_ms` covers `diff_code` alone - no parse, no
    process spawn, no IO - while every external tool's timed region is its whole subprocess:
    temp-file write, spawn, that tool's own parse and diff, and parsing its output back. Reporting
    the two side by side compared different things and flattered omnidiff by its entire parse cost
    (p50 7.09 ms against diffsitter's 8.62, which became 10.07 once the parse it had
    already measured was included - reversing the ordering the paper stated).

    `treesitter_parse_ms` is measured per repeat by the same harness, so this needs no re-run: it
