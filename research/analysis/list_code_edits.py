"""Every modified code file in the corpus's recent history, as pairs `benchmark_diff_pairs` reads.

`edit_shape_stats.py` walks the same history and keeps only aggregates, on purpose (its class doc
comment says why a per-edit CSV of the whole corpus was ruled out for git). This is the per-edit
list that walk does not write, for the one consumer that needs it: the paper's robustness run
over the whole Full corpus rather than over the fixture corpus (`make measure-robustness-full`, which starts `measure/overnight_benchmarks.sh`).
The output is the shape `sample_code_pairs` produces (`language, size_bucket, repository, commit,
path, old_path`), so `benchmark_diff_pairs --csv` takes it unchanged; `size_bucket` is empty,
since nothing here is stratified.

Only modifications and renames are listed (`--diff-filter=MR`): a creation or deletion has no
pair of versions to diff, and `benchmark_diff_pairs` would only record it as unreadable. Shallow-
boundary commits are skipped for the reason `edit_shape_stats.numstat_rows` gives, and so is the
same 50-commit cap per repository, so this lists the population `edit_shape.csv` summarises.

Not a committed artifact: hundreds of thousands of rows that are entirely reproducible from the
clones. Write it under /var/tmp/research/<mode>/ and point the benchmark at it.
