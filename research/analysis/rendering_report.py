"""
What the ground truth says about the *rendered* diff: how much of an AST ever reaches the screen,
and how often the text that reaches it has more than one correct rendering.

Two measurements, reported together because the paper uses them as one argument. The first bounds
what a syntax-aware diff has to get right - a mapping error on a node that is never displayed
cannot mislead a reader. The second shows that even once the question is narrowed to what is
displayed, the correct answer is still not always unique.

=== Visibility ===

`diff::nodes::structurally_visible_node_ids` marks the nodes that carry text of their own, the
ones a rendered diff can display. Its doc comment states the property this report needs: the set
"depends only on `code`", never on any diff of it, so the fraction below is a property of the
corpus's syntax trees rather than of any tool that walks them. That is what lets this number stand
in a section that names no tool. Per-fixture counts come from
data/quality/optimal_solutions_benchmark.csv, whose `visible_nodes` and `total_nodes` columns are
that function applied to each fixture's two files.

=== Rendering ambiguity ===

This half is the rendering-level companion to `ambiguity_report.py`. That script measures how often the
node *mapping* admits several equally correct answers; this one measures how often the painted
*text* does. The two are different questions about the same corpus, and a tool can fail either
independently: it can recover the right mapping and render it in a way no human would, or recover
a defensible rendering from a mapping that is wrong underneath.

=== What a painting is, and why a *count* of them is the measurement ===

`human_mapping.json`'s `text_mappings` field (`NamedTextMapping` in src/test/helper/human_mapping.rs)
holds zero or more named paintings, each a list of `HumanTextEntry` spans labelled Move, Update,
Insert or Delete. `human_solver` offers three names - `Minimal`, `Full`, `Only one solution` - but
the name is a label, not the datum. The datum is how many paintings a fixture carries, and
`painting_for_mode`'s doc comment states the semantics this report depends on:

  * ONE painting is a positive assertion. The painter looked at the change and judged that it has
    a single defensible rendering, so both render modes are held to that one answer.
  * TWO paintings assert that both are correct renderings of the same edit, exactly as a
    `MultiMapGroup` asserts that any consistent pairing of its members is correct. The fixture's
    validation accepts whichever the tool came closest to.

So neither cell of the split is a gap in the data. A fixture with one painting is not one that
nobody got round to painting twice; it is one an annotator examined and found unambiguous.

=== Corpus state, and the population this rate is *not* over ===

Scoped to the fixtures listed in data/quality/human_mapping_analysis.csv, the corpus state every
other number in the paper's evaluation is measured against, for the reason `ambiguity_report.py`
gives at length: a rate whose denominator drifts from the rest of the paper's is not comparable
with any of them.

Scoped further to `_common.PAPER_DATASETS`, which excludes the hand-written `handmade` fixtures -
see that constant's own comment for why. Every rate here is over changes sampled from real
commits and nothing else.

Within that scope the painted set is still *not* a random sample - painting is manual and slow,
and which fixtures have been painted is an annotation-order artifact - so the report keeps printing
the characterisation (category split, median size, language coverage) beside the rate, so the paper
states what the rate is over rather than implying a population it does not have.
