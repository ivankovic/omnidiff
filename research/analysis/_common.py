"""Helpers shared by every report script under research/analysis/.

Importable as a sibling module (`from _common import ...`) because `uv run ./analysis/foo.py`
puts the script's own directory first on `sys.path` - the same mechanism `file_stats.py` relies
on for `percentile_report`. Kept to helpers with exactly one correct implementation: a CSV
reader, the papers' LaTeX number format, the repository paths, and the chart chrome every figure
shares. Anything a report computes differently from its siblings on purpose (the various `pct`
functions, say) stays in the report.

# The fixture datasets every number in the paper is scored over.
#
# `handmade` is deliberately absent. Those 61 fixtures are minimal hand-written examples of one
# change pattern each, written to exercise the matcher; they are not draws from anything, so no
# rate over them estimates a population, and mixing them into a corpus sampled from real commits
# makes every such rate a mixture with an annotation-order artifact for a mixing proportion. The
# paper reports what real changes look like, so it reports the sampled datasets alone.
#
# **The product benchmark still scores them**, and should: `benchmark_optimal_solutions`,
# `quality_baseline.csv` and each fixture's own `#[test]` are regression coverage, where a
# hand-built minimal case is worth more than a sampled one, not less. This constant scopes the
# research reports, nothing else - which is why the two corpus sizes differ on purpose and every
# report that reads `optimal_solutions_benchmark.csv` has to filter it here rather than assume
# the producer did.
#
# `defects4j` is a real dataset like the other three and
# is reported next to them and inside every pooled total, with one caveat that belongs to the data
# rather than to this constant: only the solved subset is scored (a fixture with no
# `human_mapping.json` is invisible to every report here anyway), and that subset is whatever
# annotation has reached rather than a draw - see research/external/README.md.
