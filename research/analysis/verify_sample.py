"""Checks that every (repository, commit) in a `sample_code_pairs` CSV still resolves against the
checkouts it is meant to be measured over, and reports the per-(language, bucket) cell counts.

Why this is a gate and not a report. A sample CSV stores *pointers* - `(language, size_bucket,
repository, commit, path)` - and the blobs are read back out of the checkouts at measurement time.
That keeps the corpus small, but it means a sample is only valid while the history it points into
still exists, and shallow clones that get re-fetched drop old commits continuously. A committed
sample once decayed to ~41% unreadable, and because the losses were concentrated in
whole repositories rather than spread evenly, the surviving pairs were not a random subset: two
large projects had lost every sampled commit. A measurement over that sample would have looked
perfectly healthy in its own output while silently answering a different question.

So: run this immediately after drawing a sample, before measuring anything against it. Exit status
is nonzero if any pair fails to resolve, which is what makes it usable as a pipeline stage.

Usage (from research/):
    uv run ./analysis/verify_sample.py --repo-root /var/tmp/research/full/repositories SAMPLE.csv
