# Fetch Defects4J's per-project bug tables (`framework/projects/<Project>/active-bugs.csv` and
# `deprecated-bugs.csv` in https://github.com/rjust/defects4j): one row per bug with the buggy
# and fixed revision ids and the original bug-report URL. Both tables, because the AST-diff
# oracle and the replication package were built against an older Defects4J than today's master,
# which has since deprecated some of their bugs (Lang-18 was the first one hit) - a deprecated
# bug keeps its row, just in the other file.
#
# The oracle and the replication package both key Defects4J cases as `<Project>-<BugId>` and say
# nothing about which revision that is; these tables are what turns `Closure-157` back into a
# commit and a bug report, which is how each `defects4j` fixture's README came to carry both.
#
# The revision ids are Defects4J's, from the repositories it bundles (several were converted from
# SVN), not necessarily the upstream project's GitHub history - the README says so.
#
# 34 small CSVs, ~70 KB total. Idempotent: an existing file is not re-fetched.
