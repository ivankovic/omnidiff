# Fetch the replication package of Falleri & Martinez, "Fine-grained, accurate and scalable
# source differencing" (ICSE 2024) - Zenodo record 10474674, CC-BY-4.0.
#
# What we want from it is the `dataset/` folder: before/after file pairs for Defects4J (1046
# files), BugsInPy (643), gh-java (999) and gh-python (991), each laid out as
# `<dataset>/{before,after}/<project>/<bug or sha>/<path with / replaced by _>`. The Defects4J
# half is the source that the Alikhanifard & Tsantalis oracle's offsets index into (see
# fetch_astdiff_oracle.sh and README.md) - same flattened file names, same buggy=before /
# fixed=after orientation, verified byte-for-byte against the oracle's CompilationUnit spans.
#
# `analysis/` is kept too: `qualitative_experiment.csv` is their 100-case human study (two
# authors, a harmonised verdict, seven external participants, each choosing GumTree greedy vs
# simple vs neither), the only other human judgement of diff output we found in the literature.
# The bundled GumTree source tree and the participants' GUI are dropped - the former is on GitHub,
# the latter is 200 rendered HTML pages of no use to a scorer.
#
# Idempotent: skipped if $DEST already exists. The zip is kept next to the extraction so a re-run
# after a partial extraction does not download 54 MB again.
