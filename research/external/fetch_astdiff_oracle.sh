# Fetch the Alikhanifard & Tsantalis AST node-mapping benchmark (TOSEM 2025, arXiv 2403.05939).
#
# The ground truth is not a separate release: it is checked into the RefactoringMiner repository
# under src/test/resources/astDiff/{defects4j,commits}, ~2.2 GB of JSON. Everything else in that
# repository (the tool itself, 100+ MB of other test resources) is irrelevant here, so this is a
# depth-1, blob-filtered, sparse checkout of exactly those two directories. GitHub does not serve
# `git archive`, so a clone is the only way to get a subdirectory without the whole tarball.
#
# Idempotent: an existing checkout is left alone (re-run with REFRESH=1 to `git pull` it). The
# commit fetched is recorded in $DEST/FETCHED so a measurement can name the oracle version it was
# taken against - the checkout has grown since the paper (296 commit directories against the
# paper's 188), so "the benchmark" is not one fixed thing.
#
# See README.md in this directory for what the data is and how it is scored.
