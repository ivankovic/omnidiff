"""BDiff runner with two modes: one pair as JSON on stdout, or a timed batch over many pairs.

BDiff ships a CLI (`python -m bdiff a b`) but it *discards* the return value of `bdiff.bdiff()` and
prints nothing at all: exit code 0, empty stdout, empty stderr. The
edit script is only available from the library API, so this driver exists to expose it. Embedded
into `benchmark_other` via `include_str!` and written to a temp file at run time, the same way
`generate_mapping_site` embeds its own JavaScript, so there is no separate file to keep in sync
with the binary that runs it.

BDiff internally shells out to `git diff --no-index --diff-algorithm=... --unified=0 --numstat`
for raw change detection, which is why `benchmark_other` runs this driver with GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL
and GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM pointed at /dev/null. Without that, a user-level `diff.external` (this
project's own README recommends setting exactly that, to omnidiff itself) replaces git's diff
output, BDiff parses no `@@` headers, and it returns a **0-entry edit script with exit code 0** -
a silently perfect-looking score rather than an error. See data/comparison/PROVENANCE.md.

=== Batch mode ===

`bdiff_driver.py --batch` reads line-delimited JSON requests `{"id", "before", "after"}` from
stdin and writes one `{"id", "ms"}` response line per request, timing *only* the `bdiff.bdiff()`
call. This mirrors research/drivers/gumtree-batch for the same reason it exists: importing bdiff
pulls in numpy, scipy and rapidfuzz, which costs far more than the call being timed, so a
per-invocation wall-clock number says almost nothing about the algorithm. `benchmark_other`
reports both - `bdiff_ms` per process and `bdiff_warm_ms` from this batch - exactly as it already
does for GumTree's cold and warm JVM.
