-- Dumps Neovim's own diff classification for a two-window `nvim -d` session, as JSON on stdout:
--
--   [{"lines": [...], "subline": [...]}, {"lines": [...], "subline": [...]}]   -- [before, after]
--
-- `lines` is every 1-indexed line Neovim marks as part of the change (`diff_hlID` non-zero, i.e.
-- DiffAdd / DiffChange / DiffDelete / DiffText). `subline` is the subset of those lines carrying
-- at least one DiffText column - Neovim's *within-line* highlighting, which is the capability that
-- makes it interesting here and which no `git diff` row in this comparison has.
--
-- Why a Lua driver at all: Neovim's diff result is not written to any stream. It exists only as
-- window state, and `diff_hlID(lnum, col)` is the sole public way to read it back, per line and
-- per column. So the tool has to be driven headless and interrogated from inside.
--
-- `benchmark_other` always invokes this with `-u NONE`, so the measurement reflects Neovim's own
-- shipped defaults rather than whatever `diffopt` a developer happens to have configured. That
-- matters: `diffopt` can change the algorithm (`algorithm:histogram`) and the within-line
-- alignment (`linematch:N`), so a user config would silently make this a measurement of that
-- config instead of of Neovim.

      -- exclusive end - the runs of this line Neovim paints `DiffText` rather than `DiffChange`,
      -- i.e. the characters it considers actually changed as opposed to merely on a changed line.

      -- `nvim -d` is in this comparison at all: it is one of only two tools here whose output is
      -- finer than a line (BDiff's `str_diff` is the other), and a boolean throws away exactly
      -- the part that distinguishes it from `git diff`. `diff_hlID` takes a byte index, so a
