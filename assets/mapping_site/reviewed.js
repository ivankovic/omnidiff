// Vanilla-JS "I have reviewed this fixture" marks for the human_mapping static site. No
// framework, no build step - copied verbatim into every generated site by
// generate_mapping_site.rs, same convention as index.js and viewer.js. Unlike those two, this
// runs on *both* kinds of page: the index (where it fills a "Reviewed" column and a progress
// line) and every fixture page (where it owns the "Mark as reviewed" button). It is a third
// script rather than a copy in each because the storage format is the one thing the two pages
// must agree on exactly.
//
// The marks live in this browser's localStorage, nowhere else: the site is static and has no
// server to send them to. So they are per browser and per device, and nothing here syncs them.
//
// A mark records the *revision* it was made against - the fingerprint generate_mapping_site.rs
// bakes into each page from the mapping and the two source files - not just the fixture's name.
// The site is regenerated from src/test/data/diffs/ on every push, and a fixture that was remapped
// or repainted since it was reviewed has not really been reviewed: its mark shows as "stale", and
// the random-unreviewed picker treats it as unreviewed.
