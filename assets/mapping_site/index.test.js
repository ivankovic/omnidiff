// Plain-Node regression test for index.js's sorting logic - no framework, no npm dependency,
// consistent with this directory's own "no framework, no build step" convention (see index.js's
// header comment). Run directly: `node assets/mapping_site/index.test.js` (also wired into
// `make test` and CI - see Makefile/`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

// `dataset` only camelCases hyphens, not underscores, so a real `data-total_lines="123"` attribute
// reads back as `dataset.total_lines`, not `dataset.totalLines`. `cellValue` must look the key up
// unconverted: converting "total_lines" to "totalLines" would silently read `undefined` (-> `NaN`)
// for every row on that column (and `unix_diff`, the other underscored one) - see index.js's own
// comment on `cellValue`.

// `compareRows` must actually produce a usable ascending/descending ordering for every column,
// including the two that were broken (`unix_diff`, `total_lines`) - `Number(undefined)` is `NaN`,
// and `NaN - NaN` is also `NaN`, which `Array.prototype.sort` treats as "leave these in place"
// (never reorders), so a regression here would silently report "sorted" without throwing, exactly
// like the reported bug. Asserting the actual output order (not just that `cellValue` returns the
// right numbers, the earlier check above) is what catches that class of failure.
