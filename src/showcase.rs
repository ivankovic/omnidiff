//! The data behind the GitHub Pages showcase (`src/bin/generate_showcase.rs`): the browser viewer
//! under `assets/viewer/` running on static files. The viewer asks for JSON over `/api/*`, and the
//! showcase's fetch shim answers from files baked by these types, so the page paints what the TUI
//! would with no server behind it. Built only with `test-fixtures`, which the generator needs anyway.
//!
//! * [`payload`] is a computed diff, with every column converted from this crate's byte offsets
//!   to the UTF-16 code units a browser indexes strings by, plus syntect's highlighting as colour
//!   spans, so the page needs no highlighter of its own.
//! * [`state`] is everything the page needs to draw its first frame: themes, presets, help text.
//!
//! Everything the page decides between requests - cursor, scroll, search, the overlay painting
//! rules - is `assets/viewer/model.js`, a port of the corresponding
//! `tui::widgets::code_viewer`/`tui::components::diff_viewer` logic, tested under plain Node;
//! `app.js` draws the dialogs and wires the DOM.
