//! A picture pair on screen (see [`crate::diff::picture`]): the two pictures with their changed
//! regions outlined, or one composite of them, in four views `t` cycles through - GitHub's image
//! diff modes:
//!
//! * **side by side**: both, each region outlined in the delete (before) or insert (after) color;
//! * **difference**: the after picture faded out, its changed pixels in the update color;
//! * **blend**: the two mixed half and half, so a shifted element shows twice;
//! * **swipe**: before left of a divider and after right of it, `h`/`l` moving the divider.
//!
//! Drawn by `ratatui-image`: in a terminal that speaks the kitty, sixel or iTerm2 graphics protocol
//! (`tui::app` asks it at startup) as real pixels, and everywhere else as Unicode half blocks - two
//! pixels a cell, coarse but enough to see the layout and where the outlines are. The color-depth
//! pass fits half blocks to a 256-color terminal like any other cell.
//!
//! An animation is shown one **moment** at a time: a frame of each side, as the frame diff pairs
//! them (`FrameStep`), `,`/`.` stepping and space playing at the after side's frame times. When
//! annotating, the frames pair by position instead, since the engine's pairing is part of its
//! answer.
//!
//! Composites are rebuilt only when the view, the divider, the moment, the pane size or the colors
//! change: encoding a picture for a graphics protocol is the slow part, not drawing it.
