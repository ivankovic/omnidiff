Navigation
  Tab              Switch the active panel (Before/After)
  h/j/k/l          Move the cursor left/down/up/right
  Arrow keys       Same as h/j/k/l
  Enter            Jump to the counterpart of the range under the cursor (again: jump back)
  n/p              Jump to the next/previous change, skipping unchanged lines.
                   Walks both panels as one ordered sequence, switching sides when
                   that is where the next change is - so an insertion with nothing
                   on the before side is reached like any other change.
  g                Go to a line number
  /                Search the focused panel (smart-case; Enter jumps to nearest, Esc cancels)
                   A bare Enter repeats the last search; an empty query clears the highlights
  >/<              Jump to the next/previous search match
  Ctrl-d/Ctrl-u    Move the cursor half a page down/up
  Ctrl-e/Ctrl-y    Scroll the view one line without moving the cursor
  Page Up/Down     Scroll by a page
  Home/End         Jump to the top/bottom of the file
  Mouse            Wheel scrolls; a click places the cursor and focuses that panel

Files and diffing
  o                Open a file selector for the active panel
  1-9              On the empty start screen: reopen one of the recent file pairs
  r                Reload both files from disk and re-diff (keeps the cursor position)
  e                Open the focused panel's file in $VISUAL/$EDITOR at the cursor line
  G                Review git changes: a picker of the repository's unstaged files, staged
                   files, and recent commits (Enter unfolds a commit into its files).
                   Enter on a file opens its diff - index vs working tree, HEAD vs index,
                   or parent vs commit. `omnidiff --review` starts here.
  ]/[              Next/previous file of the set the reviewed file came from
  Esc              While a diff is computing: cancel it and keep the previous result

Pictures
  t                For a pair of pictures (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, ICO, TIFF, and Windows
                   .cur and .ani cursors): cycle the
                   view - side by side with the changed regions outlined, difference
                   (changed pixels over the faded after picture), blend, swipe. Drawn as
                   pixels where the terminal speaks kitty, sixel or iTerm2 graphics, in
                   half blocks elsewhere
  h/l, Left/Right  In the swipe view: move the divider between before and after
  ,/. and Space    For an animation: step a frame back or on, play or pause

Archives and other containers
  j/k, Down/Up     For a pair of archives (zip, jar, tar, gzip, xz, bzip2), cursor themes
                   (X cursors, Hyprland .hlc), fonts (TTF, OTF, WOFF, WOFF2, EOT), message
                   catalogs (.mo, .qm) or PDFs: move through the members that changed, were
                   added or were removed; the selected one shows beside the list - text as
                   a line diff, pictures, glyphs and pages as above
  a                Show every member, unchanged ones too, or only the changed again
  g                Show every changed member that is a picture at once, as a grid on each
                   side - a font's changed glyphs, a theme's changed cursors
  J/K, PgDn/PgUp   In a text member - diffed by OmniDiff as its language, a Java class file
                   as a listing of its methods and what they call - jump to the next or
                   previous change, or page; long lines are wrapped, long unchanged runs cut
  Enter            Open a text member in the full diff view, or a member that is itself an
                   archive in place; Backspace comes back out

Appearance
  c                Open the theme editor: a Theme dropdown, a syntax-highlighting
                   dropdown, and one editable color per diff operation, the cursor
                   counterpart, search matches, and the Before/After titles.
                   Up/Down moves, Left/Right changes a dropdown, Enter edits a color
                   (type #rrggbb) or accepts, Esc cancels. Editing any color forks the
                   selection to Custom, leaving the presets untouched.
  v                Cycle the panel layout: auto / dual / single (persisted)
  S                Toggle syntax highlighting
  H                Toggle the node highlight (off by default): the range under the
                   cursor, and its match on the other panel, highlight when part of a
                   real change. Unchanged content is never highlighted either way.
  M                Open the render-options panel: independent checkboxes for which
                   parts of the diff get painted (leading whitespace, standalone
                   punctuation), plus 1/2 shortcuts for the Minimal/Full presets.
                   Every choice is applied and saved to the config the moment it
                   is pressed. Trailing whitespace is never painted, regardless of
                   any option. Up/Down moves, Space toggles, Enter or Esc closes;
                   nothing is undone on the way out.

Other
  ?                Toggle this help
  q or Esc         Quit, from the viewer. In a dialog, Esc closes the dialog and q is
                   an ordinary letter (a search for 'query' does not end the session)
  Ctrl-C           Quit, from any screen (terminal only; in a browser it copies)
  Ctrl-Z           Suspend to the shell (Unix); `fg` comes back to the same view
