//! Single-pair worker for `apted_only_benchmark`: one whole-tree tree-edit-distance between two
//! files via `Algorithm::AptedWholeTree`, with no pipeline phases and none of the engine's own
//! shortcuts (`Algorithm::Apted`'s Myers root split and `APTED_MAX_CELLS` decomposition). That is
//! what "just run a generic tree-diff algorithm" means.
//!
//! A separate process so the driver can enforce the 1-second budget with `kill()`: most inputs
//! exceed it by design, and an abandoned thread keeps its CPU and memory while a killed process
//! returns them.
