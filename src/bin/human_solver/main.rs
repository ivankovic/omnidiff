//! Builds the ground-truth AST mappings the fixture tests grade omnidiff against.
//!
//! Run as `cargo run --bin human_solver -- <name>`, where `<name>` is a fixture directory under
//! `src/test/data/diffs/<dataset>/` (e.g. "rust-add-if"); without it the first case alphabetically
//! opens. It shows both ASTs side by side, lets a human mark nodes matched, deleted or inserted and
//! paint the text-range ground truth, and saves the fixture's `human_mapping.json` plus its
//! `src/test/fixtures/<dataset>/<module>.rs` stub. Nodes are addressed by path (kind + sibling
//! position), not node id, since ids are not stable across parses (`test::helper::path_for_node`).

Tab            switch focus between Before/After panels
Up/k, Down/j   move cursor
Left/h         collapse current node, or go to its parent
Right/l        expand current node, or go to its first child
g / G          jump to first / last visible node

m / M          match cursor nodes (M also recurses into matching children);
                 with a pending multi-map selection (see x), commits it as a
                 group instead (M asserts the matched subtree closes over
                 itself, without auto-filling descendants the way plain M does;
                 for an all-to-all selection (see X), M instead walks the
                 selected subtrees in lockstep and commits one all-to-all group
                 per position, every node down to the leaves - the subtrees
                 must agree on kind and child count everywhere, or nothing is
                 committed and the first divergence is reported)
f              repeat m until end of file or a kind mismatch needs your input:
                 there, y matches anyway, d/D or i/I mark the stopping node
                 deleted or inserted (with subtree) and f carries on, n stops
d / D          mark Before node deleted / deleted with subtree
i / I          mark After node inserted / inserted with subtree
u              unmark the focused cursor node, or remove its whole multi-map
                 group if it's a group member
v              start a range at the cursor node (again: clear it); move, and
                 the next d/D/i/I/u acts on every visible node from there to
                 the cursor - a run of inserted statements is v, j j j, I.
                 Nodes already marked are skipped, and with D/I so is anything
                 under an earlier node of the range
U / Ctrl-r     undo / redo the last change to the mapping - a mark, a group, a
                 painting, a ! reset - here and in the t view alike; nothing is
                 written until s
x              toggle the focused cursor node in/out of a pending multi-map
                 selection -- select several nodes on each side, then m/M to
                 commit them as a group where any Before node may pair with
                 any After node (leftovers on the larger side become
                 delete/insert); mixed kinds ask for confirmation first
X              flip the pending selection to all-to-all and back: every
                 Before node corresponds to every After node and nothing is
                 left over (a statement split in two, two merged into one, a
                 body duplicated). Shown as G instead of g once committed
c              clear the pending multi-map selection
a / A          align other panel to the human mapping / to omnidiff's mapping
p              re-run omnidiff's own diff in the foreground; it runs by itself in
                 the background when a case opens, and its verdict then shows
                 next to each node (`*` where it disagrees with you) with the
                 count of those in each panel's header
r              toggle showing the ASTMappingReason (which pass matched it) next
                 to each node's algo verdict
n / N          jump to next / previous mismatch (`*`) vs. omnidiff's verdict
] / [          jump to the next / previous unmarked node in this panel (wraps)
} / {          open the next / previous case as the o picker lists it - its
                 sort and filters apply, so with Unmarked filtered to yes this
                 walks the unfinished cases; unsaved changes prompt first
/              search: jump to the next leaf node whose text contains the
                 given string (plain substring, no regex)

t              text view: read the source, and paint the human text-range ground
                 truth onto it (stored beside the tree mapping, not derived from
                 it). It opens with each side's cursor on the node that side's
                 panel is on, the focused panel's side first. Tab side, hjkl/g/G move, w/b/e by word and W/B/E by
                 blank-separated word as in vim, 0/^/$ to a line's start/first
                 code character/end, v select. On a terminal narrower than
                 200 columns only the focused side is drawn; Tab shows the other. By default a selection spanning
                 several rows sweeps full lines from the anchor to the cursor, one
                 contiguous multi-line block; V toggles that to vertical -- the same
                 columns on each row, like a stack of squares, not every full line
                 swept in between. d/i paint the
                 Before/After selection deleted/inserted, m pairs BOTH sides'
                 selections as a match: a move when every span on both sides reads
                 the same, otherwise an update as a whole - so banked spans of
                 different text, several spellings extracted into one helper, are
                 one match (paint an unchanged span as its own match if you want it
                 shown as a move), u removes the range under the cursor,
                 Z marks a nothing-to-paint fixture, : jumps to a line number,
                 / searches this side's text (plain substring; Enter jumps to the
                 next match, wrapping; the last query is offered again, so / Enter
                 repeats it), Esc unselects or closes.
                 In a painting named Minimal, d/i on a multi-row full-line (V)
                 sweep is recorded as one range per row starting at that row's
                 first code character, never through the indentation -- the rule
                 invariant 6 states, kept for you instead of reported afterwards.
                 m on a full-line sweep on each side does the same and pairs the
                 rows one to one (the same number of rows on both sides, or it is
                 refused), one match per row, each a move or an update by itself.
                 A blank row in the sweep drops out; a vertical selection and a
                 Full or free-named painting are left exactly as drawn.
                 Branching a Minimal painting to one named Full (s, Enter) does
                 the opposite on the way across: every line whose every visible
                 character is painted deleted, or every one inserted, is widened
                 to start at column 0, which is what invariant 4 requires of a
                 Full painting. Only those lines -- a partly changed line, a
                 matched (move/update) line, and a branch to any other name are
                 copied unchanged, and the Minimal painting itself never moves.
                 A range that overlaps one already painted is refused at the
                 keystroke (u removes the old one first): the renderer resolves
                 an overlap by highest verdict and the scorer by list order, so
                 such a painting would look like one thing and grade as another.
                 Two ranges meeting at a line break share only the newline and
                 are fine.
                 x banks a selection so another can be made on the same side, c
                 clears the banks; banked and live ranges commit together, which
                 is how an N:M match is made -- every span on ONE side must read
                 the same, so any pairing of them says the same thing.
                 A fixture may hold several named paintings, for edits with more
                 than one defensible rendering; a check passes on ANY of them.
                 s branches the current one to another name, keeping both on
                 file (Enter copies its ranges, e starts empty; Minimal / Full /
                 Only one solution offered, none required, free-form ok); L
                 switches which one you edit; D twice in either list deletes the
                 highlighted painting, which is how a fixture painted Only one
                 solution becomes a Minimal + Full pair.
                 n / p jump BOTH panels to the next / previous hunk of the plain
                 line diff (wrapping, read off the focused side's own row), and a
                 puts the other panel on the same line number as this one and
                 scrolls it to the same place on screen -- the two ways to stop
                 hand-scrolling two independently scrolled panels
                 A puts THIS side's AST panel on the leaf under the text cursor,
                 expanding whatever is collapsed over it and focusing that panel,
                 without closing this view -- so a row an invariant names becomes
                 the node whose entry has to change. A cursor in the whitespace
                 between two tokens lands on the next leaf, and says so
                 o cycles what is drawn: your painting, omnidiff's own rendering
                 of the same pair, or only the bytes where the two disagree
                 P copies omnidiff's rendering into the current painting as a
                 starting point, so a fixture is corrected rather than painted
                 from a blank page -- only into an empty painting, so it can
                 never overwrite work (s branches this one to a new name first),
                 and it declines outright on a pair whose omnidiff ranges
                 overlap or fail to pair up, rather than seeding a painting that
                 would render and score differently
T              view the output of unix `diff -u`, with before/after line numbers
                 (t/T switch between these two views while either is open)
H              toggle hiding fully solved subtrees (unmarked nodes and their
                 ancestors always stay visible)
V              list every ground-truth invariant this case breaks: the rule's
                 number, the painting it is about, what it says, and where --
                 each site's position, the text there, and the node it falls in.
                 j/k move, g/G ends, Enter puts both trees and both text panels
                 on it (opening the text view over them, one Esc from the trees),
                 Esc closes. Read from the mapping in memory, so it sees unsaved
                 edits; the o picker's Invariant column is the same count

s              save -- or, on a sample, prompt for a name (pre-filled with
                 <language>-<repository>) and promote it
R              on a sample, prompt for a reason and reject it instead of
                 promoting it (recorded in sample.csv; no human mapping needed)
e              on a diff, enter/edit its description.md (written on Enter, empty deletes
                 it; `*` in the o picker marks cases that have one); on a sample, a
                 free-form comment (recorded in sample.csv,
                 works regardless of status; carried into the generated test stub
                 if present when later promoted)
o              open a different test case (src/test/data/diffs/) as a table:
                 Name, Dataset, Cmpl, Unmarked, Paint, Disagree, Invariant, Size.
                 j/k pick a row, h/l pick a column, s sorts by that column (again to
                 reverse), f filters on it -- substring on Name, dataset cycle on
                 Dataset, off/yes/no on the rest. Filters AND across columns.
                 Invariant counts the ground-truth invariants this case's own
                 mapping breaks, the number its invariants() test asserts on;
                 Size is the diff's changed lines, as in the O picker.
                 The scans behind Cmpl/Unmarked, Paint, Disagree, Invariant and
                 Size run on the first s or f on that column (Cmpl/Unmarked blocks
                 for ~12s and Disagree ~7s on the full corpus the first time; their
                 results are cached under ~/.local/state/omnidiff/scans/ and only
                 cases changed since are rescanned); until then those columns read
                 ?, and a ? row survives either filter direction.
                 Cursor, sort and filters persist across o, and with the case
                 last open across runs (~/.local/state/omnidiff/human_solver.json):
                 started with no name, the tool reopens where it left off.
                 Every key is appended to human_solver_keys.tsv beside it (which
                 view took it, the key, whether it edited; typed text is not
                 recorded); `human_solver --key-log-summary` shows where the
                 keys and the time between them went
O              open a sampled candidate (src/test/data/samples/) as a table:
                 Name, Lang, Bucket, Status, Size. Same keys as o -- j/k pick a
                 row, h/l pick a column, s sorts by that column (again to
                 reverse), f filters on it: substring on Name, a value cycle on
                 Lang and Bucket, sampled/SOLVED/REJECTED on Status, and
                 off/nonempty/empty on Size (an empty diff is a broken draw).
                 Bucket is the LOC stratum the sample was drawn for, ? for one
                 sampled before strata were recorded, and a ? row survives the
                 Bucket filter either way. Filters AND together across columns.
                 Cursor, sort and filters persist across O
C              open a commit from this repo's own git log, then a file it
                 changed -- before/after are that file at the commit's parent
                 and at the commit itself; s promotes into handmade/

!              start this case from scratch: clears the tree mapping, its
                 multi-map groups and every named painting at once, after a
                 confirmation. Nothing is written until s, so reopening the case
                 without saving gets it back
