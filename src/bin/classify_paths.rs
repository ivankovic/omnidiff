//! Classifies paths into the file-type categories of `code::tip`, the classifier behind the
//! introductory paper's corpus figures, for research scripts that cannot call it: one path per line
//! on stdin, `path<TAB>category` per line on stdout, the category empty when the classifier has none.
//! `analysis/change_census.py` uses it so its census counts in the same categories as the paper.
