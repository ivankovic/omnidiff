//! **One file per fixture, holding every judgement this repository makes about it.**
//!
//! A file carries at most four tests, under fixed names, over the fixture's two independent ground
//! truths (see `HumanTextMapping`) - a fixture can map every node right and still paint the wrong
//! bytes:
//!
//!   * `mapping()` - the node mapping against `human_mapping.json`'s `entries`, exact or clamped to
//!     a recorded number of mismatches.
//!   * `mapping_details()` - specific nodes asserted by hand; accompanies `mapping()`, never
//!     replaces it.
//!   * `painting()` - the rendering against `text_mappings`, clamped to a percentage of disagreeing
//!     bytes under both the `Minimal` and `Full` presets of
//!     [`RenderOptions`](crate::diff::text::RenderOptions). Only for painted fixtures.
//!   * `invariants()` - the ground truth checked against itself.
//!
//! One file per fixture is load-bearing: a clamp's explanation needs a home nothing regenerates,
//! and a clamp only moves when someone edits its file. A shared file regenerated wholesale loosens
//! clamps that still hold, which is why `human_mapping::stub_mapping_limits` reads these files
//! rather than writing them. A painting clamp is a percentage because fixture sizes span three
//! orders of magnitude; lower it when a change earns it, and treat a rise as a regression.
//!
//! **What a stub comment says.** The fixture's `description.md` says what the fixture *demands*
//! (a fact about the data). A stub comment says why omnidiff *falls short* of it (a fact about this
//! implementation, false once fixed), and is the only justification a clamp gets.
//! `the_clamped_stubs_explain_their_limits` enforces that every clamped `mapping()` has one.

// One `#[cfg(test)] mod <name>;` per fixture, per dataset (see `test::helper::DIFF_DATASETS`), and
// one per content family (`diff::content::Family`): `pictures` (see `test::helper::human_picture`)
// and the container families (see `test::helper::human_content`), whose stubs assert verdicts
// rather than the four tests above.
