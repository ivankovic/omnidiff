    // Several subjective quality decisions:
    //
    // 1. The lowest-cost solution reuses parts of `..nums.len()` for `HashSet::new()`, which no
    //    human would do. The cost is tied, so it is a `MultiMapGroup` and omnidiff's choice is
    //    accepted.
    // 2. `return Some(nums[i])` / `return Some(num)` should match, which requires bridging a
    //    removed loop-nesting level; the structural matchers do not. Every mismatch on the
    //    if/return chain (`APTED("qualified_name")`) is this gap, left open rather than risk a
    //    broad "bridge removed nesting" heuristic.
    // 3. Two nested `for` loops become one: their `for`, `{` and `}` are all-to-all 2:1 groups,
    //    each leaving one before member unavoidably unmatched.
