//! This fixture's language has no tree-sitter grammar, so there is no tree to map
//! and no `mapping()` test here. omnidiff renders the pair with its plain-text
//! fallback diff (`plain_text_line_diff`), and that is what the `painting()` test
//! below is graded against - see `PaintingDiff::PlainText`.
