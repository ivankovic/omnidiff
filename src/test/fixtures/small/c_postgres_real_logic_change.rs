    // Many "human quality" choices:
    // 1. Two `if(remote_slot->confirmed_lsn > latestFlushPtr)` sites merge into one, previously
    //    `if(found_consistent_snapshot)` and `if(remote_slot_preceedes)`; either mapping is
    //    defensible (the second matches the logic better, the first avoids a leading Delete).
    // 2. In the same `if`, two identical `ereport`s become one: 2-to-1.
    // 3. The third modified `ereport` simply moved, which a reviewer should see.
    // 4. Its surrounding `if` matches both the before `if` around the `ereport` and the one at the
    //    same location: another 2-to-1.
    // The unmarked nodes left are all at that N:M site, which no `MultiMapGroup` can encode; the
    // limit is high because the mapping is specific, not because omnidiff is wrong there.
