    // Two deliberate human choices:
    // 1. `pwd = passwords->elts` -> `cb_data.pwd = (*passwords)->elts` should match: a small
    //    textual edit whose AST change is large (the dereference and parentheses), subjectively
    //    optimal rather than edit-distance optimal.
    // 2. `pwd++` -> `cb_data.pwd++` maps `identifier` "pwd" to `field_identifier` "pwd": matching
    //    by kind alone would update `pwd` into `cb_data` and insert a new "pwd", which a human would
    //    not. So cross-kind matches must be allowed.
    // Partly resolved by `prematch_identical_statement_siblings` and `ContainmentCtx`'s
    // sibling-order-consistency check.
