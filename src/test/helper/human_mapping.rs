//! Human-authored ground truth for a fixture, `<fixture dir>/human_mapping.json`, written by the
//! `human_solver` binary: a node mapping (`entries`, `groups`) and independent text paintings
//! (`text_mappings`), plus the checks that grade omnidiff against them.
//!
//! Nodes are identified by *path* (see [`super::path_for_node`]), not node id: ids are not stable
//! across the separate parses that write and later check a mapping.
//!
//! **On disk, a whole identical subtree is one entry.** Every node gets an entry, and almost all of
//! them are `identical` under an `identical` parent: one entry per unchanged node made the corpus
//! 3.6 GB of JSON for 104 MB of code, which every checkout wrote and every grading run parsed. The
//! file therefore has one form the in-memory [`HumanOperation`] does not: `identical_with_children`,
//! a pair whose subtrees match node for node. [`load`] expands it into one `Identical` entry per
//! node pair, in pre-order, with the paths [`super::path_for_node`] gives them - exactly the entries
//! the file held before the form existed - so nothing past `load` knows it exists. [`save`] collapses
//! every run of entries that is exactly such an expansion, and keeps the entries as they are when
//! re-expanding would not reproduce them, so the round trip is lossless by construction. Expanding
//! needs both trees, which is why [`load_with`] takes the parsed pair and [`load`] parses it.
//!
//! **Code in a string is a mapping of its own.** [`HumanMapping::embedded`] holds one
//! [`HumanEmbeddedLayer`] per pair of host strings whose code a human mapped and painted as a file
//! (TSX in a JSON `"content"`, `diff::embedded`): a whole nested mapping over the decoded text,
//! stored collapsed against the decoded pair like any file. Grading descends into it - its node
//! decisions against omnidiff's layer at the same host pair ([`assert_matches_human_mapping`]),
//! its painting projected into the host files where the string is ([`compare_painting_with_diff`]),
//! its invariants against the decoded pair - and the host's own painting is not read over a painted
//! layer's bytes.
//!
//! A host with painted layers and no painting of its own is painted empty when its files read the
//! same outside those layers' strings ([`implied_host_painting`]): every change is then inside a
//! layer, so nothing is left for the host to paint. Byte equality, not the host's tree mapping,
//! decides it, so an unfinished mapping cannot imply a painting. Anywhere else no painting still
//! means unpainted.
