//! Properties every fixture's *ground truth* should hold, checked against the ground truth alone.
//!
//! Nothing here runs `diff_code`. The mapping and painting tests grade omnidiff against
//! hand-authored data; these check that data against itself, so they fail only when a fixture's
//! mapping and paintings disagree with each other. The numbers are stable and referenced
//! elsewhere ("invariant 16"):
//!
//! 1. [`rows_end_on_visible_characters`] - no painted run ends in a row's *trailing* whitespace.
//! 2. [`full_painting_covers_minimal`] - every byte painted under `Minimal` is painted under `Full`.
//! 3. [`delimiter_pairs_agree`] - a bracket and its partner carry one verdict in the tree mapping.
//! 4. [`full_paints_a_wholly_changed_line_whole`] - a `Full` line whose every visible character is
//!    inserted, or every one deleted, has no unpainted byte before its last visible character.
//! 5. [`no_unpainted_whitespace_between_painted_regions`] - a `Full` painting never breaks one
//!    highlight in two over whitespace.
//! 6. [`minimal_never_paints_leading_whitespace`] - a `Minimal` painting never claims a line's
//!    indentation (the mirror of 5).
//! 7. [`painted_ranges_do_not_overlap`] - no two ranges of one painting claim the same byte.
//! 8. [`presets_agree_on_what_survives`] - a byte one preset paints `Move` is never painted
//!    `Insert` or `Delete` by the other.
//! 9. [`mapping_and_painting_agree_on_what_survives`] - a byte the painting paints `Move` is never
//!    one the tree mapping leaves unmatched.
//! 10. [`paired_leaves_are_not_deleted_and_inserted`] - a leaf the mapping pairs with a
//!     byte-identical leaf is never painted `Delete` while its partner is painted `Insert`.
//! 11. [`removed_leaves_are_painted`] - a named leaf the mapping deletes or inserts has at least
//!     one painted byte.
//! 12. [`edited_leaves_are_painted`] - a leaf the mapping pairs with a leaf that reads differently
//!     is painted on at least one side.
//! 13. [`painting_implies_mapping_edits`] - a painting that records an edit belongs to a mapping
//!     that records one too.
//! 14. [`identical_entries_are_token_identical`] - an `Identical` entry's two subtrees carry the
//!     same tokens.
//! 15. [`match_but_not_identical_entries_differ`] - a `MatchButNotIdentical` entry's two subtrees
//!     do not read byte-identically with every descendant paired inside.
//! 16. [`identifier_updates_are_painted_by_preset`] - a renamed identifier is painted at its own
//!     preset's granularity: `Minimal` marks the differing words or characters, `Full` marks it
//!     entire.
//! 17. [`boolean_flips_are_one_edit`] - a boolean the mapping pairs is not painted `Delete` on one
//!     side and `Insert` on the other.
//! 18. [`single_valued_fields_hold_a_pair`] - a matched pair's single-valued named field holds a
//!     matched pair, never a delete beside an insert, when the two read as one token each and
//!     differ in kind (`0` -> `nullptr`).
//! 19. [`tokens_are_painted_whole`] - every byte of an operator such as `<=`, a boolean, or an
//!     access modifier such as `private` carries the same highlighting.
//! 20. [`wrapped_tokens_are_paired`] - a node that is nothing but one unnamed token, such as C's
//!     `null` around `NULL` or `nullptr`, in a position a matched pair pins, is paired with one of
//!     its own kind there: `NULL` -> `nullptr` is one element changing its text, never a delete
//!     beside an insert.
//! 21. [`painted_updates_are_not_removed`] - a token painted as one `Update` span of its own is
//!     not deleted or inserted by the tree mapping.
//! 22. [`identical_pairs_are_not_painted_removed`] - a named leaf the tree mapping pairs with an
//!     identical leaf is not painted wholly `Delete` (before) or `Insert` (after), whatever its
//!     partner's painting (10 needs both).
//! 23. [`painted_matches_hold_the_mapping_partner`] - a named leaf inside a painted `Match` has its
//!     tree-mapping partner inside, or overlapping, that `Match`'s spans on the other side.
//! 24. [`call_dots_go_with_their_member`] - in a call whose member is inserted, deleted or moved
//!     while its object stays, the dot is painted like the member (`.bar()` leaves whole), unless
//!     the member starts a later row: then the dot ends the object's row and is painted with it.
//! 25. [`removed_statements_take_their_terminator`] - a statement the tree mapping deletes or
//!     inserts is painted alike at its first byte and its closing `;`, unless the `;` survives
//!     with a value the statement wraps.
//! 26. [`terminators_follow_their_statements`] - the tree mapping pairs a statement's `;` with the
//!     `;` of the statement it pairs the statement with, and deletes or inserts it with a statement
//!     it deletes or inserts - unless the `;` goes with a value the statement wraps.
//!
//! 4 and 5 read only the paintings `FULL` answers to (see [`paintings_with_labels`]); `MINIMAL`
//! is free to leave whitespace alone. 9 is the only rule comparing the two ground truths'
//! rendered labels: they may chunk an edit differently, but cannot disagree about what survives.
//! 10 to 15 read the tree mapping through [`Caches`], so they can ask about pairs and do not
//! inherit the column-shift `Move` artifact that limits 9 to one direction. 14 compares tokens,
//! not text, because `Identical` subtrees may differ in whitespace. 19 is also a rule of the
//! renderer, which reads the same token list.
//!
//! Rejected as invariants: delimiter agreement *within a painting* (a `}` legitimately moves
//! while its `{` stays) and "a matched pair lands in one painting entry" (a rename is ordinarily
//! painted as a `Delete` plus an `Insert`).
//!
//! **All twenty-five are intra-fixture**; `cross_fixture_convention_census`
//! (`tests/exploratory.rs`) covers the cross-fixture axis. They run as each fixture stub's
//! `invariants()` test, so a fixture records its own known violations beside its other clamps
//! rather than in a corpus-wide exemption list.

/// * **The node is matched and its token deleted and inserted.** Matching `null` with `null`

/// Unlike invariant 18 this holds for equal kinds too: `null` against `null` is the case it exists

/// the author may call unrelated; a node that is only a keyword-like token has no identity beside
/// its position. Nodes of that shape: C/C++ `null`, Rust `boolean_literal`, C++
/// `access_specifier`. The corpus had none of either break when this was added (2026-09-30,
/// `pinned_lexeme_census`); a leaf against a wrapped token (`0` -> `nullptr`) is invariant 18's.
