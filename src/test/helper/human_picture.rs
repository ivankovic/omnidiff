//! Human-authored ground truth for a picture pair: `src/test/data/pictures/<name>/human_picture.json`,
//! written by `human_solver` beside the pair's `before.<ext>.test` / `after.<ext>.test`.
//!
//! **A verdict, not regions.** The human answers the one question [`Verdict`] asks - content
//! change, no visible change, resized, replaced or frame rate change - and the fixture checks the
//! engine's [`PictureDiff::verdict`](crate::diff::picture::PictureDiff::verdict) against it. Which
//! regions changed is postponed: drawing them by hand in a terminal is the expensive part, and the
//! verdict already tests what the engine decides first (whether anything visible changed at all).
//!
//! The picture fixtures live outside `src/test/data/diffs/`, the code corpus, because everything
//! that sweeps that corpus parses its pairs as text.
