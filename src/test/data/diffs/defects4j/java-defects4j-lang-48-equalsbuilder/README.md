This fixture is Defects4J bug **Lang-48** (https://github.com/rjust/defects4j): `before.java.test`
is the buggy revision (`97f1c120c092916f2f95439b6440a8977c66ee0a`) and `after.java.test` the fixed revision
(`e199d381f8c199801fee2d40a7f3ea1380700631`) of the file above, byte for byte as shipped in the GumTree Simple
replication package (Falleri & Martinez, ICSE 2024, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10474674),
which is also the exact text the Alikhanifard & Tsantalis AST-diff oracle's offsets index into.
The revision ids are Defects4J's own, from the repositories it bundles, and are not guaranteed
to resolve in the upstream repository's history. Original bug report: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LANG-393

Defects4J has since deprecated this bug (in version 3.0.0: JVM11.Not.Repoducible); the AST-diff oracle and the replication package predate that and still carry it.
