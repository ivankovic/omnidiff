This fixture is Defects4J bug **JacksonDatabind-89** (https://github.com/rjust/defects4j): `before.java.test`
is the buggy revision (`6cd5be98485a5fe8920846bb0b47a0fec87113be`) and `after.java.test` the fixed revision
(`ddfddfba6414adbecaff99684ef66eebd3a92e92`) of the file above, byte for byte as shipped in the GumTree Simple
replication package (Falleri & Martinez, ICSE 2024, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10474674),
which is also the exact text the Alikhanifard & Tsantalis AST-diff oracle's offsets index into.
The revision ids are Defects4J's own, from the repositories it bundles, and are not guaranteed
to resolve in the upstream repository's history. Original bug report: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1737

Defects4J has since deprecated this bug (in version 3.0.0: Duplicate); the AST-diff oracle and the replication package predate that and still carry it.
