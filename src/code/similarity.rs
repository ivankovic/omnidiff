//! A *similarity*-preserving sketch, as opposed to the four *equality* hashes in
//! [`crate::code::hash`], which say nothing once two subtrees differ in one token.
//!
//! A bottom-k MinHash sketch of the set of *leaf* hashes in a node's subtree, built bottom-up with
//! the equality hashes and compared in O(k) whatever the subtree size. Leaves, not every
//! descendant: one changed token flips the full hash of every ancestor, so a one-token edit would
//! cost O(depth) elements instead of one.
//!
//! [`SimilaritySketch::jaccard`] is exact when both subtrees have fewer than [`SKETCH_WIDTH`]
//! distinct leaves and an estimate above. Rank and gate with it; never conclude equality from it.
