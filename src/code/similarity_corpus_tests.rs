//! [`crate::code::similarity`] measured against two real corpus fixtures, rather than against
//! synthetic sets of integers as its own unit tests are.
//!
//! `yaml-draios-sysdig-string-url-change` permutes six near-identical URLs in one ordered
//! `flow_sequence`; `css-wordpress-reformat` has the near miss the equality hashes can only call
//! "different".
