//! Matching two syntax trees, and the text ranges that matching implies.
//!
//! [`Diff::from_code`] is the entry point ([`diff_code`] is the same function). It runs a fixed
//! pipeline of passes over both trees; each pass matches some of the nodes the passes before it
//! left unmatched, and the last one records a delete or insert for whatever is still undecided. The
//! order below is the code's; the call-site comments in `Diff::pending_with_config` and
//! [`PendingDiff::finish`] say why each pass sits where it does, and each pass's `solve` doc
//! explains its mechanism. The right-hand column maps the code's phase numbers to the paper's
//! ("OmniDiff", `research/papers/introductory-paper`); the code's numbering has gaps (there is no
//! phase 3 or 5).
//!
//! | Code phase | Pass | Paper |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 1 | `solve_hash_descent`: identical, then same-shape subtrees by hash | phase 1 |
//! | 1b, 1c | `solve_nested_condition_collapse`, `solve_heritage_clause_growth`: pairs phase 1 cannot see, attributions it cannot make | - |
//! | 2 | `solve_leading_siblings`, `solve_identical_diagnostic_statements` | phase 2 |
//! | 4 | `solve_syntax_aware_matching`: flat containers by Myers, qualified names, imports, `solve_greedy_anchor_blocks`; APTED inside each matched pair | phase 3 |
//! | 6 | residual: named-local prematch, `solve_bottom_up_propagation`, `solve_unique_type_matching`, the Myers-LCS fallback ([`apted::for_roots_fallback`]), propagation again, `solve_orphaned_leaves` | phase 4 |
//! | 7 | `solve_moved_subtrees`: GumTree-style move recovery | phase 5 |
//! | 8, 8b, 9 | `solve_mutual_ancestors`, `solve_leaf_neighbour_agreement`, `solve_wrap_growth`: refine and re-tag existing pairs | - |
//! | 10 | `solve_unresolved_nodes`: delete/insert for every undecided node | closing step |
//!
//! [`text`] turns the finished node mapping into the byte ranges the viewers paint.
//!
//! **N:M groups.** An [`ASTDiff`] can also say that several nodes correspond to several others as
//! a whole - one statement became two, three copies became one - which no one-to-one mapping can.
//! [`ASTDiff::add_group`] records one, and the node maps stay one partner per node: each member
//! holds a *representative* partner inside its group, so every pass that reads "has a key" as
//! "decided", and every caller of [`ASTDiff::mapping_for_node`], keeps working. Whoever needs all
//! of a node's partners asks [`ASTDiff::before_partners`] / [`ASTDiff::after_partners`]. The pipeline
//! does not produce groups yet: the ground truth does not yet tell a copy from identical new code
//! in a way a pass could detect (AGENT_LOG, N:M Phase 0), so today only a human mapping's
//! all-to-all groups arrive here, through `test::helper::human_mapping`.
