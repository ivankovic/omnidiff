//! Syntax-aware code diffing on tree-sitter ASTs.
//!
//! [`diff_strings`] is the entry point: it parses both sides into [`code::Code`] and returns a
//! [`diff::Diff`]: the mapping between the two syntax trees plus the changed text ranges it implies.
//! The `tui` feature adds the terminal viewer built on it.
//!
//! # Stability
//!
//! This crate is published for the `omnidiff` binary. Its stable contracts are the command line
//! and the `--mode json` output, which the editor integrations consume. The library API - the
//! `diff` module's submodules (`apted`, `cost`, `nodes`, `text`, `text_range`), the `tui` module,
//! and the `tree_sitter` and `ratatui` types in their signatures - is the binary's internals made
//! visible, and changes between 0.x minor versions without notice. [`diff_strings`] and the
//! [`code`] and [`diff`] module roots are the parts meant for use from another crate.
