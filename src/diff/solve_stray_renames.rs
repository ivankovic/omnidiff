//! Phase 9b: undoes a rename that crossed into another construct. A single-token node the
//! mapping renames (`Update`) must sit in the same place on both sides: under parents that are
//! paired with each other, or at least of one kind. Otherwise the tree edit distance has taken one
//! leaf of a replaced expression and relabelled it into the new one - `RegularTimePeriod` of
//! `RegularTimePeriod.DEFAULT_TIME_ZONE` renamed into `zone` (`java-defects4j-chart-8-week`) -
//! where the reader sees the old expression gone and a new one in its place.
//!
//! Only unpairs; phase 10 records the delete and the insert.
