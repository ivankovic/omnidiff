//! Pictures: what changed between two raster images, for the files a code diff cannot read.
//!
//! The change census (`research/data/corpus_stats/change_census.csv`) puts images at 39% of the
//! binary files commits change (fonts, the other big share, come from about thirty repositories),
//! and PNG in 8.4% of repositories - the most widespread binary format by far. A picture pair gets what a reader asks first: whether the picture changed size
//! or format, how much of it changed, and where.
//!
//! **Which pixels changed** is pixelmatch's perceptual test (Mapbox's `pixelmatch`, after
//! Kotsarenko and Ramos, "Measuring perceived color difference using YIQ NTSC transmission color
//! space"): both pixels blended over white by their alpha, the YIQ distance compared against
//! `THRESHOLD` of its maximum. Unlike exact equality it does not report re-encoding noise as change,
//! and unlike a per-channel tolerance it weighs brightness as the eye does.
//!
//! **Where** is the changed pixels grouped into rectangles: pixels within `REGION_GAP` of each other
//! belong to one region, so one edited icon is one region rather than a scatter of its pixels.
//!
//! Pictures of different sizes are not compared pixel by pixel - nothing says which pixel became
//! which - and are reported as resized. SVG is not a picture here: it is XML, and the XML grammar
//! diffs it structurally (`code::language::XML_FORMAT_EXTENSIONS`).
