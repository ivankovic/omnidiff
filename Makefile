# Product-side targets: build, test, install, benchmarks, the quality gate, and release.
#
#   benchmark-   measures omnidiff alone, against src/test/data/ (accuracy and speed in one run).
#   check-       gates that fail CI, each on exactly what a benchmark- target measures. Not in
#                .githooks/pre-push: a slow hook is worse than none.
#   measure-     anything beyond omnidiff alone (other diff tools, the upstream corpus): lives in
#                research/Makefile, never here.
#
# Corpus fetching, sampling, analysis and paper builds are research/'s too
# (`cd research && make <target>`). Nothing here invokes a research/ target.

# One feature set for every local release-binary target, so alternating targets does not re-link
# the fat-LTO binary (cargo fingerprints by feature set; `stats` is a superset of `test-fixtures`).
# CI's quality job overrides it with the smaller set to keep git2/rusqlite out of its cache.
