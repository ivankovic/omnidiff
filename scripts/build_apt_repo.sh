# Build a signed apt repository from a directory of .deb files.
#
# The result is a self-contained static tree, meant to be served from GitHub Pages alongside the
# rest of the site (see .github/workflows/pages.yml). Nothing here is committed to the repo: the
# pool is rebuilt from the .deb assets of the GitHub releases on every run, so the published
# repository is always a pure function of the releases that exist. Losing it costs one workflow
# run, not a recovery.

#
# The signing key comes from the environment, never from an argument (arguments show up in `ps`
# and in workflow logs):
#
#   APT_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY   required, ASCII-armoured private key (`gpg --armor --export-secret-keys`)
#   APT_GPG_PASSPHRASE    optional, only if that key has one
#
# See packaging/README.md for how to generate that key and load it as a repository secret.
