// Flattens a baked showcase payload into per-row coloured runs, for scripts/record_diff_gif.py to
// draw.
//
// This exists so the GIF is painted by the viewer's own logic rather than by a second
// implementation of it. `assets/viewer/model.js` decides which columns a range covers on a row, that
// trailing whitespace is never painted, and which paint wins where they overlap - rules with
// enough corners (`columnsOnRow`, `trimmedRowLen`, the paint order in `rowPaints`) that a Python
// re-implementation would drift from the browser without anyone noticing, and the GIF would then
// advertise a rendering the product does not produce. Node is already a dev dependency here: this
// is the same file `make test-viewer-js` covers.
//
//   node scripts/diff_gif_segments.js <payload.json> <state.json>
//
// stdout is `{before: {name, language, rows: [[{text, fg, bg}, ...], ...]}, after: {...}}`, where
// `fg`/`bg` are `#rrggbb` or null.
