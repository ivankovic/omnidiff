"""Regenerate the Gentoo ebuild's ``CRATES`` block, and the Manifest's crate digests, from Cargo.lock.

Lives here rather than beside the ebuild so ruff covers it: CI lints research/, scripts/ and
assets/ only.

Gentoo's ``cargo.eclass`` fetches every crate in the dependency graph individually, so the ebuild
has to name all of them. ``pycargoebuild`` is the usual tool for this,
but it is not always installed, and the job is small enough to not need it: every registry crate in
Cargo.lock becomes one ``name@version`` line.

Only entries with a ``source`` key are emitted. The ``omnidiff`` package itself has none (it is the
workspace root, unpacked from the release tarball rather than fetched from crates.io), and neither
would any git or path dependency - none exist today, and if one is ever added it must be handled
explicitly in the ebuild rather than silently dropped into ``CRATES``, so this script fails loudly
instead of skipping it.

Usage:  python3 scripts/generate_gentoo_crates.py [--check] [--manifest]

Rewrites the ``CRATES="..."`` block of every ebuild under packaging/gentoo/ in place. ``--check``
exits non-zero instead of writing, for CI.

**The Manifest is checked too, and that is a separate failure from the ebuild's.** Gentoo fetches
each crate against the Manifest's digests, and a Manifest whose ``CRATES`` list is current can
still name **older versions in its crate digests, or lack a crate's line entirely**, because the
two files drift apart over dependency bumps that only touch the ebuild. ``--check`` therefore also
asserts that the set of ``name-version.crate`` DIST lines is exactly Cargo.lock's - that drift,
caught without needing a single byte of any crate.

It does not check the *digests*, because BLAKE2B and SHA512 cannot be derived from the sha256
Cargo.lock records; that needs the files. ``--manifest`` rebuilds those lines from ``.crate`` files
in the local cargo registry cache, verifying each one's sha256 against Cargo.lock before hashing
it, and downloading whatever the cache is missing. The ``.tar.gz`` line is left alone either way:
it hashes the GitHub *tag* tarball, which does not exist until a release is tagged, so it is a
post-release step by construction (see packaging/README.md).
