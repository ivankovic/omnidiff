"""Checks that every packaging recipe names the version `Cargo.toml` does.

`Cargo.toml` is the source of truth: the binary reports `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`, `make deploy-github`
tags `v<that>`, and `release.yml` builds whatever the tag names. Three recipes under packaging/
repeat the number by hand, and nothing else compares them:

* `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD` - `pkgver=`
* `packaging/gentoo/dev-util/omnidiff/omnidiff-<version>.ebuild` - the file name
* `packaging/nix/package.nix` - the `version ?` fallback

A recipe left on the previous version fetches the previous tag's tarball and builds the previous
release under the new number, which is worse than failing. Run by `make check-versions`, which
`deploy-checks` and CI's python job both call.

Usage:  python3 scripts/check_version_sync.py
