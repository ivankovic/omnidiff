"""Record the GIF that contrasts GNU diff with omnidiff on one change.

Both halves are the *same* two files in the *same* viewer: only the ranges differ, because
`generate_showcase` bakes every case twice - once as omnidiff maps it, once as the real GNU `diff`
marks it (whole touched lines). That is what makes a wipe the right transition here: the code does
not move, so a bar sweeping across it swaps one reading for the other in place and the reader's eye
stays on the line it was already looking at.

Nothing here decides what to paint. `scripts/diff_gif_segments.js` runs the browser viewer's own
`assets/viewer/model.js` over each baked payload and hands back per-row coloured runs; this file only
turns those runs into pixels. See that script's header for why.

    make diff-gif

Fonts come from matplotlib's bundled DejaVu Sans Mono rather than from fontconfig, so the frames
are identical on any machine that can run this - a system font lookup would make the recording
depend on what happens to be installed.
