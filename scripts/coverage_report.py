"""Turn `cargo llvm-cov --json --summary-only` into a per-area table.

llvm-cov's own table is one row per file, hundreds of them here, which buries the thing worth
knowing: the diff engine and the dev tools are held to very different standards on purpose.
`src/bin/` holds samplers, benchmark harnesses and human_solver - tools whose value is what they
let a human do, several of which exist to be run once and read. Averaging them together with
`src/diff/` produces a number that means nothing about either.

Reads the JSON on stdin so it composes with whatever llvm-cov invocation the caller wants.

`--badge` additionally writes a shields.io endpoint file, which is what the README's badge reads.
Both numbers go on it: a badge showing only the product figure would be quietly choosing the
flattering half, and one showing only the overall figure would describe the sampler harnesses
rather than the diff engine.

# engine's submodules and `src/diff.rs` is the engine's own root. Matching only
# the directory would send every one of those roots - diff, code, test, stats, tui - to `other`,
# which no row prints and no total but EVERYTHING counts, and the product figure would silently
