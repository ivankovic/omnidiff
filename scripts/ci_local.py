"""Runs every check `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs, locally, in this working tree.

Unlike `.githooks/pre-push` - which is a deliberately fast, hand-picked subset - this is a full
mirror, and it is a mirror *by construction*: the commands come from parsing ci.yml itself, not
from a copy of them kept in step. Adding a job or changing a flag in ci.yml changes what this runs,
with no second edit. That is the entire point; a hand-maintained duplicate of CI is worth less than
no local CI at all, because it goes stale silently and you find out from GitHub anyway.

What it cannot mirror is the runner: this uses the toolchain, OS and installed tools you already
have, where GitHub gets a clean ubuntu-latest with a pinned toolchain each time. So this catches
your mistakes, not "works on my machine" ones. `act` would close that last gap by running the
workflow in a container, at the cost of a from-scratch build of a crate whose release profile is
`lto = "fat"`, `codegen-units = 1` - tens of minutes per feature config, every time, with no
incremental `target/` to reuse. That trade is not worth it for the common case, which is "did I
break CI before I push".

Actions (`uses:`) have no local equivalent and are translated by the table below. An action this
script has never seen is a hard error rather than a silent skip: a new `uses:` in ci.yml is a
deliberate decision about what runs locally, and quietly ignoring it would reintroduce exactly the
drift this design exists to prevent.
